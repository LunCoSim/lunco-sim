# LunCo

LunCo is an open-source engineering software for Lunar Settlement design built with Godot 4.

*For older version check branch godot3.5*

## Vision

LunCo provides a set of opensource applications for Lunar Base engineering including:
1. Requirements Management
2. Models visualisations
3. Collaborative training
4. Digital twin of a lunar colony


## Installation

0. The development is done on Linux Mate, so there could be issues running on Windows and MacOs. Please reach us
1. Install [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/download/)
