## üõ† Installation

0. The development is done on Linux Mate, so there could be issues running on Windows and MacOs. Please reach us
1. Install [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/download/)
	1. Your Godot installation has to be available via comammand line. Check [this](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html) tutorial to set it up

2. Install [FBX2glTF](https://github.com/godotengine/FBX2glTF/tags):
	1. Download the file and place it somewhere. Do not put it into LunCo folder, as you could have issues with git
	2. Godot will ask for this file when you will open the project
3. Install [git lfs](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs#getting-started)
4. Clone this repo in a terminal: 
```bash
	git clone -b main --single-branch --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim.git
```
5. After cloning, change directory to project folder
```bash
	cd lunco-sim
```

6. Run below command to install addons using [gd-plug](https://github.com/imjp94/gd-plug)
```bash
	./install_addons.sh
```

7. Open the project in Godot and run
