4. **Decentralized Engineer Profiles**: Create your decentralized engineer profile. Manage access, showcase your projects, and connect with peers in a secure and transparent manner.
	
5. **Interactive Training Modules**: Engage in hands-on training sessions within the LunCo platform. Simulate real-world lunar scenarios, test your designs, and receive instant feedback, all within a dynamic and interactive environment.

## üõ† Installation

0. The development is done on Linux Mate, so there could be issues running on Windows and MacOs. Please reach us

1. Install [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/download/)
   1. Your Godot installation has to be available via command line. Check [this](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html) tutorial to set it up

2. Install [FBX2glTF](https://github.com/godotengine/FBX2glTF/tags):
   1. Download the file and place it somewhere. Do not put it into LunCo folder, as you could have issues with git
   2. Godot will ask for this file when you will open the project

3. Content Management Setup (we're transitioning between two systems):
   
   A. Git LFS (currently used for most content):
   1. Install [git lfs](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs#getting-started)
   2. Enable git-lfs in the repository after cloning: `git lfs install`
   
   B. LunCo Content Manager (new system, gradually being adopted):
   1. Will be installed automatically with other addons
   2. After installation, you'll see a "Content" button in the editor toolbar
   3. Use it to download missing content files when needed

4. Clone this repo in a terminal: 
```bash
git clone -b main --single-branch --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim.git
```

5. After cloning, change directory to project folder
```bash
cd lunco-sim
```

6. Open the project in Godot and run

### Content Management Notes
- Some large files are still managed by git-lfs
- Newer content will use `.content` files for external storage
- If you see missing files:
  1. First try git-lfs: `git lfs pull`
  2. Then use the Content Manager in the editor toolbar
  3. If issues persist, please reach out on Discord
