## üåå Vision

Our vision is to provide a comprehensive suite of open-source applications tailored for Lunar Base engineering, including:

- **Unified Platform**: LunCo serves as a central hub, bringing together the best of open-source space engineering tools, offering a unified experience for users.
- **Requirements Management**: Streamline and manage your project requirements with ease.
- **Models Visualizations**: Visualize and interact with your designs in a 3D environment.
- **Collaborative Training**: Train and collaborate with your team in real-time.
- **Digital Twin**: Create a digital replica of your lunar colony for simulations and analysis.

## üõ† Installation

0. The development is done on Linux Mate, so there could be issues running on Windows and MacOs. Please reach us

1. Install [Godot 4.4 Beta 2](https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-beta-2/#downloads)

2. Install [git lfs](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs#getting-started). It handles large files in the repository.

3. Clone this repo in a terminal: 
```bash
git clone -b main --single-branch --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim.git
```

4. After cloning, change directory to project folder
```bash
cd lunco-sim
```

5. Enable git-lfs in the repository after cloning: 
```bash
git lfs install
```

6. We still need to download the content files from git-lfs. Run the following command to download them:
```bash
git pull --recurse-submodules
git lfs pull && git submodule foreach git lfs pull
```

7. Now open project and wait till intenal conent management downloads all the files. LunCo Content Manager (new system, gradually being adopted):
   1. Will be installed automatically with other addons
   2. After installation, you'll see a "Content" button in the editor toolbar
   3. Use it to download missing content files when needed

8. Wait till all the files are downloaded. You'll see the message in the Output tab.

9. Restart editor and enjoy!


### Content Management Notes
- Some large files are still managed by git-lfs
- Newer content will use `.content` files for external storage
- If you see missing files:
  1. First try git-lfs: `git lfs pull`
  2. Then use the Content Manager in the editor toolbar
  3. If issues persist, please reach out on Discord
