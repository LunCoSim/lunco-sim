# Terrain and render-quality diagnosis

Read [`geo-assets`](../geo-assets/SKILL.md),
[`docs/architecture/50-usd-driven-visuals.md`](../../docs/architecture/50-usd-driven-visuals.md),
and the target scene's composed USD before changing a shader or asset. The
authored USD Material/Shader network and its assets own visual intent; the
runtime binder projects that intent to Bevy.

## Diagnose in order

1. Confirm the terrain prim, `material:binding`, Material surface connection,
   shader `info:wgsl:sourceAsset`, and authored `inputs:albedo_map`/
   `inputs:normal_map`/weights in the composed stage. A composed-stage read is
   the runtime truth; do not open layers from a tutorial.
2. Inspect the actual asset role and color space. An orthophoto/albedo is the
   terrain colour source; hillshade, slope, elevation colour, and mineral
   diagnostics are not substitutes for it. Keep role-aware filtering and mip
   generation intact.
3. Check the authored light and shadow contract, GPU shadow-resource status,
   and `primvars:doNotCastShadows` before changing material brightness. A
   renderer fallback that silently removes shadows is a failure to surface,
   not a quality setting to hide.
4. Compare a settled frame sequence, not one screenshot. Fast color changes
   usually indicate changing inputs, repeated derived bakes, missing asset
   readiness, or unstable lighting—not a reason to clamp the image in a
   shader. Find the owner and gate the work by asset/revision events.

Use `inspect-simulation`, `record-video`, or the API screenshot surface for
visual evidence. Preserve authored shadow maps, terrain resolution, BigSpace,
and physics settings. If an asset is missing, report the owning cache or
manifest error visibly instead of adding a procedural fallback.
