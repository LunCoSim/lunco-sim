# Lunar Colony Simulator (LunSim)

A game-first approach to lunar colony simulation built with Godot 4.4 and GDScript, with a path toward potential Modelica integration in the future.

## Overview

LunSim combines engaging gameplay mechanics inspired by factory-building games like Factorio with an intuitive node-based building system. Build, manage, and optimize a sustainable lunar colony while learning about the challenges of extraterrestrial habitation.

## Core Philosophy

- **Game-First Experience**: We focus on creating fun, engaging gameplay before adding simulation complexity
- **Visual Feedback**: All actions provide immediate, satisfying visual and audio feedback
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple and gradually unlock more challenging systems
- **Intuitive Building**: Using Godot 4.4's GraphElement for a smooth building experience
- **Early Validation**: Gameplay recording and validation ensure mechanics are enjoyable

## Core Features

- **Resource Chains**: Manage interconnected systems for oxygen, water, power, food, and materials
- **Visual Building Interface**: Build your colony using an intuitive node-based system
- **Lunar Environment**: Deal with the unique challenges of the lunar surface
- **Engaging Feedback**: Satisfying visual and audio feedback for all player actions
- **Gameplay Recording**: Built-in system to record and share colony development

## Development Approach

1. Start with fun, engaging gameplay
2. Add visual and audio feedback for all actions
3. Validate core mechanics through gameplay recordings
4. Build from simple working systems to more complex ones
5. Add simulation depth while maintaining engagement
6. Consider optional Modelica integration as a long-term goal
