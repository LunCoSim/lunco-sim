## Core Features

- **Game-First Experience**: Accessible and engaging gameplay that gradually introduces simulation complexity
- **Resource Chains**: Manage interconnected systems for oxygen, water, power, food, and materials
- **Visual Editor**: Build your colony using an intuitive node-based interface
- **Lunar Environment**: Deal with the unique challenges of the lunar surface
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple and gradually unlock more complex systems

## Target Audience

- Gamers interested in space and colony simulation
- Educational settings (later development phases)
- Space industry professionals (advanced features)
