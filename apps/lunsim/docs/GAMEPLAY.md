# LunSim Gameplay Guide

## Getting Started

### Tutorial Mission
New players begin with a guided tutorial mission:
1. Build a basic solar power system
2. Connect a habitat module
3. Add basic life support
4. Learn about resource management

### Sandbox Mode
After completing the tutorial, players can:
- Start with predefined scenarios
- Build from scratch with all components unlocked
- Set custom challenge parameters

## Core Gameplay

### Building Your Colony

#### Component Placement
1. Select a component from the palette
2. Place it on the grid
3. Configure its properties
4. Connect it to other components via ports

#### Connection Rules
- Components must have compatible ports to connect
- Some connections require specific resource types
- Distance limitations may apply for certain components

### Resource Management

#### Resource Types
- Each resource has unique properties and behaviors
- Resources are produced, stored, consumed, and transformed
- Resource balancing is key to colony survival

#### Flow Management
- Monitor resource flows between components
- Balance production and consumption
- Create storage buffers for critical resources
- Handle waste and byproducts

### Optimization Challenges

#### Efficiency
- Improve component placement for better efficiency
- Upgrade components for better performance
- Minimize resource waste

#### Expansion Planning
- Plan for future growth
- Create modular systems
- Build redundancy for critical systems

### Time System

#### Lunar Day/Night Cycle
- A full lunar day (29.5 Earth days) drives the gameplay cycle
- Solar power only works during lunar daytime
- Temperature extremes between day and night

#### Simulation Speed
- Pause: For building and detailed planning
- Normal: Standard gameplay
- Fast: For rapid development or waiting

### Crisis Management

#### System Failures
- Components may fail or degrade
- Power outages
- Resource shortages

#### Environmental Challenges
- Radiation events
- Meteorite impacts
- Dust storms

## User Interface

### Build Mode
- Graph-based view of components
- Connection visualization
- Component palette
- Property editor

### Monitor Mode
- Resource level displays
- Flow rate indicators
- Efficiency metrics
- Alert notifications

### Time Controls
- Pause/play/fast-forward
- Day/night indicator
- Mission timer

## Progression

### Initial Challenges
1. **Power Management**: Balance day/night power needs
2. **Basic Life Support**: Maintain oxygen and water
3. **Resource Collection**: Establish mining operations

### Intermediate Challenges
1. **Closed Loop Systems**: Create recycling systems
2. **Expansion**: Support more colonists
3. **Manufacturing**: Create advanced components

### Advanced Challenges
1. **Self-Sufficiency**: Eliminate Earth resupply
2. **Research**: Develop new technologies
3. **Colony Specialization**: Focus on specific industries

## Game Modes

### Campaign

- Structured goals and challenges
- Progressive technology unlocks

### Sandbox
- All components available
- Customizable starting conditions
- No failure conditions

### Challenge Mode
- Specific scenarios with limited resources

## Tips for New Players

1. Start small and expand gradually
2. Always build excess power capacity
3. Create redundant life support systems
4. Monitor resource flows constantly
5. Plan for the long lunar night early
6. Build storage buffers for critical resources
7. Pay attention to efficiency metrics
