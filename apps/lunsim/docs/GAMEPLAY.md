# LunSim Gameplay Guide

## Core Design Philosophy

- **Game-First Approach**: Focus on fun, engaging mechanics before simulation complexity
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate, satisfying feedback for all player actions
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, gradually introduce more complex systems
- **Accessible Building**: Intuitive controls for component placement and connections
- **Resource Visualization**: Clear visual representation of resource flows and states

## Getting Started

### Tutorial Mission
New players begin with a guided tutorial mission:
1. Build a basic solar power system with satisfying visual feedback
2. Connect a habitat module and see resources flow through connections
3. Add basic life support with visual and audio feedback
4. Learn about resource management through gameplay, not just text

### Sandbox Mode
After completing the tutorial, players can:
- Start with predefined scenarios
- Build from scratch with all components unlocked
- Set custom challenge parameters
- Share creations via built-in recording system

## Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Place components** from the palette onto the grid
2. **Connect components** via intuitive connection lines
3. **Optimize flow** of resources between components
4. **Observe results** with visual and audio feedback
5. **Expand and overcome** challenges as the colony grows

### Building Your Colony

#### Component Placement
1. Select a component from the palette
2. Place it on the grid (with satisfying snap/placement effects)
3. Configure its properties via intuitive interface
4. Connect it to other components via ports (with visual connection feedback)

#### Connection Rules
- Components must have compatible ports to connect
- Visual indicators show compatible connection points
- Connection process has visual and audio feedback
- Real-time feedback on connection quality and efficiency

### Resource Management

#### Resource Types
- Each resource has unique visual representation and behaviors
- Resources visibly flow between components
- Resource levels are visualized intuitively
- Critical shortages have clear visual and audio warnings

#### Flow Management
- Monitor resource flows with visual indicators
- Balance production and consumption with intuitive controls
- Create storage buffers for critical resources
- Handle waste and byproducts with visual feedback on environmental impact

### Optimization Challenges

#### Efficiency
- Visual efficiency indicators on components
- Satisfying feedback when efficiency improves
- Component upgrades have visible effects on performance
- Efficiency improvements unlock new possibilities

#### Expansion Planning
- Grid system makes planning intuitive
- Blueprint mode for pre-planning
- Visual indicators for future expansion possibilities
- Modular design is rewarded with bonuses

### Time System

#### Lunar Day/Night Cycle
- Dynamic lighting represents lunar day/night
- Solar panels visibly react to sunlight levels
- Temperature visualization shows extremes
- Day/night transitions have atmospheric visual effects

#### Simulation Speed
- Pause: For building and detailed planning
- Normal: Standard gameplay
- Fast: For rapid development or waiting
- Time controls have intuitive UI and feedback

### Crisis Management

#### System Failures
- Components show visible damage states
- Power outages affect lighting and component operation
- Resource shortages trigger visual and audio warnings
- Repair activities have satisfying visual feedback

#### Environmental Challenges
- Radiation events with visual effects
- Meteorite impacts with dramatic visual and physics effects
- Dust accumulation visually affects solar panels and equipment

## User Interface

### Build Mode
- Graph-based view of components with clear visual hierarchy
- Connection visualization with flow direction indicators
- Component palette with intuitive categories and search
- Property editor with visual feedback on changes

### Monitor Mode
- Resource level displays with intuitive gauges and meters
- Flow rate indicators with animated graphics
- Efficiency metrics with color coding for quick assessment
- Alert notifications with priority-based visual and audio cues

### Time Controls
- Pause/play/fast-forward with intuitive icons
- Day/night indicator with visual timeline
- Mission timer with progress indicators
- Time of day affects lighting and environment

## Early Gameplay Validation

### Recording System
- Built-in gameplay recording for sharing and validation
- Capture key moments with screenshot system
- Time-lapse recording for showing colony growth
- Sharing system for community feedback

### Quick Feedback Loop
- Early playtesting focused on "fun factor"
- Prototype validation through gameplay videos
- Iterative improvement of visual and audio feedback
- Community involvement in early stages

## Tips for New Players

1. Start small and expand gradually
2. Always build excess power capacity
3. Create redundant life support systems
4. Watch the visual flow indicators to spot problems early
5. Plan for the long lunar night early
6. Build storage buffers for critical resources
7. Use the blueprint mode for planning expansion
