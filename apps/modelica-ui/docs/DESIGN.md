# LunSim Game Design Document

## Core Game Loop

1. **Gather Resources**: Extract regolith, water ice, and metals from the lunar surface
2. **Build Infrastructure**: Construct habitats, power systems, and life support
3. **Manage Resources**: Balance consumption, production, and storage
4. **Expand**: Grow your base to support more operations and colonists

## Initial Resource Chains

### 1. Power Chain
- **Solar Panels**: Generate power during lunar day
- **Batteries**: Store energy for lunar night
- **Power Distribution**: Connect buildings to power grid
- **Challenge**: 14-Earth-day lunar night requires significant storage

### 2. Life Support Chain
- **Oxygen Generation**: Extract oxygen from regolith
- **Water Recycling**: Filter and reuse water
- **Air Circulation**: Distribute oxygen throughout habitats
- **CO2 Scrubbing**: Remove carbon dioxide from air

### 3. Habitat Chain
- **Living Quarters**: House colonists
- **Airlocks**: Allow EVA operations
- **Thermal Regulation**: Manage extreme temperature variations
- **Radiation Shielding**: Protect colonists from solar radiation

### 4. Resource Production Chain
- **Regolith Mining**: Extract basic materials
- **Water Ice Mining**: Extract water from permanently shadowed regions
- **Metal Refining**: Process regolith into usable metals
- **3D Printing**: Create components from refined materials

## Game Mechanics

### Building Placement
- Node-based building system
- Connection validation between compatible components
- Spatial considerations (radiation exposure, thermal efficiency)

### Resource Management
- Visual resource flow indicators
- Storage capacity management
- Efficiency optimization challenges

### Time Controls
- Speed controls (pause, normal, fast)
- Day/night cycle indicators
- Critical event warnings

### Progression System
- Tech tree for unlocking new buildings and capabilities
- Mission objectives for guided progression
- Efficiency ratings and optimization goals

## User Interface

### Main View
- Top-down perspective of lunar base
- Building grid overlay
- Resource flow visualization

### Building Interface
- Component palette for selection
- Property editor for configuration
- Connection manager for resource flows

### Monitoring Interface
- Resource levels and trends
- System efficiency metrics
- Alert system for critical issues

## Future Considerations

- Weather events (solar storms, meteorite impacts)
- Crew management
- Research and development
- Expanded tech tree
- Trade with Earth

## POC Scope

For the initial proof of concept, we will focus on:

1. Basic power generation and storage
2. Simple oxygen production and circulation
3. Essential habitat construction
4. Limited resource extraction
