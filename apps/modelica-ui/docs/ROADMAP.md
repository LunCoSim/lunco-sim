## Implementation Priorities

For each phase, development will follow this sequence:

1. **Core Framework**
   - Essential systems implementation
   - Focus on functionality first

2. **Component Development**
   - Basic building blocks
   - Resource flow testing

3. **User Interface**
   - Controls for interaction
   - Visualization of states

4. **Testing & Refinement**
   - Gameplay testing
   - Performance optimization
   - Bug fixing

## POC Milestone Checklist

The POC will be considered complete when:

1. [ ] Basic component system works with GraphElement
2. [ ] Resources can flow between components
3. [ ] Simple simulation updates resource values
4. [ ] Components can be placed and connected visually
5. [ ] Resource flows have basic visualization
6. [ ] A small working lunar base can be created

## Development Approach

- Start with minimal implementation that demonstrates core concepts
- Make one system work completely before adding complexity
- Implement features in small, testable increments
- Focus on creating a solid foundation before adding advanced features
- Use object-oriented design for clear extension points

## Timeline Estimates

- **Phase 0**: 2-4 weeks
- **Phase 1**: 1-2 months
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 months
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 months
- **Phase 4**: 4-5 months
- **Phase 5**: TBD (long-term)

## Milestone Evaluation Criteria

Each phase will be considered complete when:

1. All listed features are implemented
2. Testing shows stability and performance targets are met
3. User feedback has been incorporated
4. Documentation is complete
5. The release target is ready for distribution
