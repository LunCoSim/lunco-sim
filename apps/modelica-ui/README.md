# Lunar Colony Simulator (LunSim)

A game-first approach to lunar colony simulation built with Godot 4.4 and GDScript, with a path toward potential Modelica integration in the future.

## Overview

LunSim combines engaging gameplay mechanics inspired by factory-building games like Factorio with an intuitive node-based building system. Build, manage, and optimize a sustainable lunar colony while learning about the challenges of extraterrestrial habitation.

## Development Strategy

We're using a phased approach, starting with a focused Proof of Concept:

1. **POC Phase (Current)**: Create a minimal functioning prototype demonstrating core mechanics
2. **MVP Phase**: Expand to a fuller gameplay experience with more components
3. **Feature Expansion**: Progressively add depth and complexity
4. **Full Experience**: Complete game with campaign, challenges, and comprehensive systems

## Core Philosophy

- **Game-First Experience**: We focus on creating fun, engaging gameplay before adding simulation complexity
- **Visual Feedback**: All actions provide immediate, satisfying visual and audio feedback
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple and gradually unlock more challenging systems
- **Intuitive Building**: Using Godot 4.4's GraphElement for a smooth building experience
- **Early Validation**: Gameplay testing ensures mechanics are enjoyable

## Current Focus (POC)

- **Basic Building System**: Place and connect simple components
- **Resource Flows**: Visualize electricity, oxygen, and water moving between components
- **Core Components**: Solar panels, batteries, and habitat modules
- **Simple Simulation**: Resource production, storage, and consumption

## Implementation Plan

1. Create core component framework with GraphElement
2. Implement basic resource system
3. Add connection functionality
4. Create visual feedback for resource flows
5. Implement simple time controls
6. Balance initial components for demonstration
