## Dependencies and Critical Path

The following dependencies exist between milestones:

1. Parser (1.1) -> Component Model (1.2) -> Equation System (1.3)
2. Core Framework (Phase 1) -> Simulation & UI (Phase 2) -> Game World (Phase 3)
3. Game World (Phase 3) -> Resource System (Phase 4) -> Progression (Phase 5)
4. Component Model (1.2) -> MSL Integration (Phase 6)
5. All previous phases -> Performance Optimization (Phase 7)

Critical path items that may present the highest risk:
- Equation system solver performance for real-time use
- Integration between Modelica simulation and Godot physics
- Resource transport system scalability
- Performance with large numbers of components

## Next Steps

Immediate focus should be on:

2. Beginning work on the Simulator class
3. Consolidating existing duplicate functionality
4. Implementing a comprehensive testing framework
