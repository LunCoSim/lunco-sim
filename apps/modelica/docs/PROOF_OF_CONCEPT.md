# Proof of Concept Implementation Plan

This document outlines a simplified proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation to validate the core architectural decisions of the Modelica-Godot integration. The PoC will focus on a limited set of functionality that demonstrates the key aspects of the system while minimizing development time.

## Objectives

1. Validate the integration between Modelica simulation and Godot game engine
2. Test the performance of real-time simulation for interactive use
3. Verify the component-based design approach
4. Assess the user experience of building and simulating systems
5. Identify potential issues before full-scale implementation

## Scope

The PoC will implement a simplified lunar power generation and distribution scenario with the following components:

1. **Solar Panel**: Generates power based on sunlight exposure
2. **Battery**: Stores and provides energy
3. **Power Consumer**: Represents a generic power-consuming device
4. **Power Line**: Connects power components together

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Core Simulation Framework (1 week)

1. Create a simplified ModelicaComponent class with basic variable and equation support
2. Implement a basic DAESystem with solver for simple equations
3. Create a Simulator class to manage the simulation process
4. Add support for component connections and equation generation

**Deliverable**: A working simulation engine that can solve simple power flow equations.

### Step 2: Component Implementation (3 days)

1. Implement Solar Panel component:
   - Parameters: efficiency, area
   - Variables: power output, sun exposure
   - Equations: output = efficiency * area * sun_exposure

2. Implement Battery component:
   - Parameters: capacity, max charge/discharge rate
   - Variables: state of charge, power input/output
   - Equations: d(state_of_charge)/dt = power_input - power_output

3. Implement Power Consumer:
   - Parameters: power consumption
   - Variables: power input
   - Equations: power_input = power_consumption

4. Implement Power Line:
   - Parameters: efficiency
   - Variables: power input, power output
   - Equations: power_output = power_input * efficiency

**Deliverable**: A set of basic components that can be connected and simulated.

### Step 3: Visual Representation (3 days)

1. Create simple 3D models for each component
2. Implement component placement in the Godot world
3. Add visual connection lines between components
4. Create basic UI for component selection and placement

**Deliverable**: A visual representation of the power system with component placement functionality.

### Step 4: Interactive Simulation (2 days)

1. Implement simulation controls (start, stop, speed)
2. Add day/night cycle for solar panel output variation
3. Create visual feedback for power flow and battery charge
4. Implement basic parameter adjustment interface

**Deliverable**: An interactive simulation that responds to user input and shows system behavior.

### Step 5: Testing and Validation (2 days)

1. Create a series of test scenarios:
   - Basic power flow from solar to consumer
   - Battery charging and discharging cycles
   - Multiple consumers with varying loads
   - Power line efficiency effects

2. Measure and optimize performance:
   - CPU usage during simulation
   - Frame rate with multiple components
   - Solver iteration count and stability

3. Gather user feedback:
   - Ease of system construction
   - Clarity of simulation results
   - Responsiveness of controls

**Deliverable**: A set of test results and performance metrics to inform full implementation.

## Success Criteria

The PoC will be considered successful if:

1. The simulation runs at 30+ FPS with at least 20 components
2. Solver converges reliably for all test scenarios
3. Component connections correctly propagate changes through the system
4. User can build and simulate a working power system
5. Day/night cycle visibly affects system behavior

## Extensions (if time permits)

1. Add a simple resource extraction component (e.g., mining machine)
2. Implement basic power storage visualization
3. Create a simplified research mechanism to unlock components
4. Add a basic objective system

## Implementation Notes

### Simplifications for PoC

1. Use simplified equations rather than full Modelica complexity
2. Focus on electrical domain only (no mechanical, thermal, etc.)
3. Use fixed time step rather than adaptive stepping
4. Implement basic UI without full customization
5. Use placeholder graphics for visual elements

### Technologies

1. GDScript for all implementation
2. Godot's built-in UI system for interface elements
3. Simple shader for power flow visualization
4. CSV export for simulation results

## Evaluation Plan

After completing the PoC, evaluate the following aspects:

1. **Architectural Fit**: Does the component-based approach work well with both Modelica and Godot?
2. **Performance**: Can the system handle real-time simulation at interactive frame rates?
3. **Usability**: Is the system intuitive for users to build and simulate?
4. **Extensibility**: How difficult would it be to add more component types?
5. **Integration**: Do the various modules (simulation, visualization, interaction) work well together?

Document findings and recommendations for the full implementation phase.
