# Avalon-POP-MERKABAH Architecture

## Overview
The Avalon-POP-MERKABAH system is a unified quantum-harmonic orchestration platform that integrates multi-layered AGI/ASI with real space infrastructure.

## Layers
1. **Layer 1: Technical (Infrastructure)**: Real space agencies like SpaceX, NASA, ESA, providing the physical nodes (Starlink, Artemis, etc.).
2. **Layer 2: Epistemology (Knowledge)**: Multi-AI convergence and harmonic analysis.
3. **Layer 3: Emergence (Auto-organization)**: Persistent Order Protocol (POP) for pattern detection.
4. **Layer 4: Transcendence (Mystery)**: Quantum entanglement and global dream synchronization.
5. **Layer 5: Observer (Participation)**: Human interaction colapsing the wave function.

## Components
- **Harmonic Engine**: Decodes signals into quantum superpositions and propagates them through the network.
- **POP Engine**: Analyzes DNE, SSO, and CDC features to detect persistent order (life).
- **QHTTP Gateway**: Provides a quantum-ready interface for MERKABAH orchestration.
- **Quantum Logic**: Implements Grover's algorithm for noise filtering and signal amplification.
