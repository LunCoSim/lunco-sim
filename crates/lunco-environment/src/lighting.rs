//! # Lighting — the sky's light sources, as physical parameters
//!
//! The single, documented source of truth for **what the bodies in the lunar
//! sky *are*** as far as lighting and rendering are concerned: how bright they
//! shine ([illuminance](LunarSun::illuminance_lux)), how big they appear
//! ([angular diameter](LunarSun::angular_diameter_deg)), and the camera
//! exposure that pairs with the key light.
//!
//! This lives in `lunco-environment` because **lighting is environmental
//! state** — the lighting analog of gravity. Every consumer that reads these
//! values (the camera spawns in `lunco-celestial` / `lunco-sandbox` /
//! `lunco-usd-sim`, and the runtime `SetEnvironmentLight` tuner here) already
//! sits at or above this crate. The lone exception is the `lunco-usd-bevy`
//! `DistantLight` loader, which sits *below* environment and therefore cannot
//! read these — but it never needs to: it builds its light from *authored* USD
//! attributes (`intensity`/`exposure`/`inputs:angle`), with its own local
//! fallbacks. The render-side `lunco_render::LunarSunShadow` (cascade/bias/atlas)
//! is the separate shadow-config home.
//!
//! ## Two real light sources
//! The airless Moon's surface is lit by exactly two things: the **Sun** (the
//! hard key light) and **earthshine** (Earth's faint blue reflected fill).
//! Both are defined here so they read as one coherent picture.
//!
//! ## TODO — make this realtime
//! These are **static almanac values** for the Shackleton-region surface. The
//! intended end state is ephemeris-driven: Sun direction + distance (hence
//! illuminance and angular size) and Earth phase (hence earthshine) computed
//! from sim time / orbital position by a runtime `Sun`/`Earth` entity. When
//! that lands, the constants here become the **fallback/default** and the live
//! values flow from that entity.
