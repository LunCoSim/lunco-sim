//! REPRODUCED: `JointCollisionDisabled` on a joint whose two bodies are ALREADY
//! TOUCHING corrupts Avian's island contact list. This is an upstream avian bug,
//! and `lunco-usd-avian` hits it on its normal path.
//!
//! ## The bug
//!
//! `on_disable_joint_collision` (`joint_graph/plugin.rs:290-295`) deletes the
//! bodies' contact edges straight out of the `ContactGraph` with
//! `remove_edge_by_id` and NEVER calls `IslandManager::remove_contact`. Avian's
//! own correct pattern is three lines away in `narrow_phase/mod.rs:447-459` —
//! `let has_island = contact_edge.island.is_some();` … `islands.remove_contact(…)`
//! BEFORE the delete. The joint path just skips it.
//!
//! So the island's intrusive contact linked list keeps a node whose `ContactId`
//! has been freed — and `ContactId`s are RECYCLED (`stable_graph.rs:307`). The
//! next island op that walks that list dies on a freed slot.
//!
//! ## What is PROVEN, and what is NOT
//!
//! PROVEN here: the corruption above is real, it panics
//! (`islands/mod.rs:608:18`, `remove_contact` unwrapping `contact_island.prev`),
//! it fires on our exact bundle-insert path, and it needs no `validate` feature.
//! That alone is a bug we must fix.
//!
//! NOT PROVEN: that this is what caused the LIVE crash. That one was
//! `islands/mod.rs:547` — `add_contact` unwrapping `island.head_contact` — on a
//! gizmo drag. Every attempt here lands on `:608` instead, INCLUDING
//! `corrupted_island_then_a_new_contact_is_added`, which corrupts the island and
//! then deliberately drives a fresh `add_contact` into it. So `:547` remains
//! un-reproduced. The two lines are the same class of dangling-list-node fault
//! and the crashed scene does author revolute joints with `JointCollisionDisabled`
//! — which makes this a strong SUSPECT for the live crash, not a closed case.
//! Do not write it up as solved until `:547` itself is reproduced.
//!
//! ## It is TIMING, not the bundle — and that is the whole fix
//!
//! The bundle is CORRECT and is not the bug. Bevy writes a whole bundle before
//! firing observers, so `add_joint_to_graph` reads `Has<JointCollisionDisabled>
//! == true` and the `JointGraphEdge` is BORN `collision_disabled`; the broad
//! phase then never creates the pair at all (`bvh_broad_phase.rs:275-283`) and no
//! contact edge ever exists to be mis-deleted. That is
//! `joint_bundle_attached_before_contact_never_forms_a_pair`, green.
//!
//! Born-disabled prevents a pair from FORMING; it does not clean up one that
//! already exists. So the rule is: **the joint must be attached before the first
//! narrow phase that could put its bodies in contact.** Attach the identical
//! bundle onto already-touching bodies and it walks into
//! `on_disable_joint_collision` and corrupts the island —
//! `joint_and_collision_disabled_inserted_as_one_bundle`, `#[should_panic]`.
//!
//! This was OUR bug on the authored-joint path. `build_usd_physics_joints` gates
//! on `With<Position>` (needed — attaching before admission panics `merge_islands`
//! "Neither body … is in an island") but used to run in `Update`, where that gate
//! can only open AFTER avian has already stepped. The joint therefore always
//! arrived a tick late, into live contacts. It now runs in
//! `PhysicsSystems::Prepare` — after admission has flushed, before
//! `StepSimulation`'s broad/narrow phase — which is the one window where both
//! conditions hold. `lunco-usd-sim`'s synthesized wheel joint had hit this exact
//! race earlier and was fixed by attaching synchronously; the authored path kept
//! the bug until now.
//!
//! The policy itself lives in ONE place, `lunco_usd_avian::joint_bundle` — the
//! only sanctioned way to attach a joint, so the marker cannot drift away from
//! its joint per call site or per joint type.
//!
//! The `#[should_panic]` tests below fail WITHOUT the `avian-validate` feature —
//! they are real crashes in an ordinary build, not diagnostic artifacts. They are
//! `should_panic` because the fault is upstream and we are not forking avian: if a
//! future avian bump fixes `on_disable_joint_collision`, they go green-when-
//! expected-to-panic and tell us the constraint has lifted.
//!
//! ## Read this before trusting a green in this file
//!
//! `joint_collision_disabled_on_already_touching_bodies` is GREEN and PROVES
//! NOTHING: its two boxes sit side by side abutting at exactly zero penetration
//! and never form a touching contact. Move them into a gravity-pressed stack
//! (`stacked_app`, guarded by `stacked_bodies_are_actually_touching`) and the same
//! sequence panics. It is kept as a monument to that false negative — an
//! "already touching" test that never touched. Any physics test here must PROVE
//! its precondition holds; `harness_actually_steps_physics` guards the other
//! trap (a bare `app.update()` loop steps NO physics at all).
//!
//! ## Still-green shapes, now meaningful as regression guards
//!
//! The gizmo's Dynamic→Kinematic swap and the scene-teardown path stay green,
//! including under `validate` (which asserts AT the corrupting mutation rather
//! than at the delayed unwrap). So the gizmo drag did not CAUSE the live crash —
//! it was merely the next `add_contact` to trip over corruption already seeded by
//! a joint. lunco's gear joint is likewise ruled out: it is a PD force law, not
//! an avian joint, registers nothing with the `JointGraph`, and adds no
//! `JointCollisionDisabled`.
//!
//! Diagnostic (asserts at the corrupting mutation, graph-wide, slow):
//!   cargo test -j2 -p lunco-usd-avian -p lunco-physics \
//!       --features lunco-physics/avian-validate --test gizmo_body_swap_islands

/// The `LoadScene` panic "Island IslandId(N) does not exist"
/// (`islands/mod.rs:1403`) — WHERE THE EVIDENCE ACTUALLY STANDS.
///
/// It is VALIDATE-ONLY: under `--features lunco-physics/avian-validate` every
/// scene change dies on it, while the same build WITHOUT the feature survives
/// repeated scene switches cleanly (verified 17-Jul-2026).
///
/// The live backtrace contains NO LUNCO FRAME — the panicking code is avian's own
/// `#[cfg(feature = "validate")]` block:
///   21: EntityWorldMut::despawn_no_free_with_caller   <- a despawn (ours; any despawn)
///   20: RawCommandQueue::apply_or_drop_queued         <- flush DURING it
///   14: islands::{impl#8}::on_remove::{closure_env#1} <- the cfg(validate) block
///    3: unwrap_or_else -> "Island IslandId(0) does not exist"
///
/// The mechanism that fits: `on_remove` (`:1338`) frees islands SYNCHRONOUSLY
/// (`remove_island`, `:1374-1376`) but queues its check DEFERRED
/// (`world.commands().queue(...)`, `:1390`). One body's on_remove leaves the
/// island populated → queues `validate(island_N)`; a later body empties and frees
/// island_N; the flush then runs the first check against a freed id.
///
/// ⚠ NOT REPRODUCED, ACROSS EVERY SHAPE TRIED. This test tears a multi-body
/// island down through one recursive `try_despawn` + flush and stays GREEN under
/// the feature. So did each variant, and each was MEASURED rather than assumed
/// (`probe_island_shape_before_despawn`):
///   - flat despawn (every body directly, one queue) — green;
///   - recursive despawn of a scene root — green;
///   - ASLEEP (probe: `asleep=4/4` at 180 steps) — green;
///   - AWAKE (probe: `asleep=0/4` at 30 steps; the live app tears down a jittering
///     scene, so awake is the honest shape) — green;
///   - with joints in the island, bodies + joints under one root — green.
/// In every case the probe confirms the precondition actually held: one shared
/// `IslandId(0)`, 7 touching pairs. The theory predicts a panic in all of them.
/// It does not happen.
///
/// So the deferred-check story is CONSISTENT with the backtrace and NOT CONFIRMED
/// by a repro. Something in the live teardown is still unmodelled.
///
/// What is established is narrow, and worth stating exactly:
///   - the panicking frame is avian's, validate-gated, with no lunco code in the
///     unwind path;
///   - without `validate`, the same teardown is clean.
/// That is NOT proof our teardown is correct — only that this panic is not
/// evidence against it. Do not upgrade this to "pure instrumentation, our side is
/// fine" without a repro that actually fires.
///
/// Regardless: `IslandId` is an arena index (`next_push_index()`, `:463`) and
/// RECYCLED, so a deferred check can silently land on a DIFFERENT island — false
/// greens as well as false reds on despawn-heavy paths.
