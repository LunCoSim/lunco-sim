//! # Unified wheel parameter model
//!
//! ONE reader for BOTH wheel kinds. A wheel prim's full dynamics — drivetrain
//! (peak torque, spin limits, brake), tire (μ, slip stiffness), inertia and
//! optional suspension compliance — are read here into a single [`WheelParams`],
//! regardless of whether the wheel is realised as a raycast wheel
//! (`lunco_mobility::WheelRaycast`, analytical spring + force-at-hub) or a
//! physical wheel (avian `RevoluteJoint` + velocity motor). The two kinds
//! differ ONLY in how force is generated; every number they act on comes from
//! the same attributes with the same strictness.
//!
//! ## Attribute provenance
//!
//! PhysX-compatible names are used where NVIDIA's vehicle schema models the
//! concept (we adopt NAMES, not PhysX runtime semantics — see
//! `core/physxSchema.usda`); `lunco:` names cover LunCo-only concepts:
//!
//! | Param | Attribute | Required |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | radius | `physxVehicleWheel:radius` | yes |
//! | mass | `physics:mass` | yes |
//! | moment of inertia | `physxVehicleWheel:moi` | no (0 ⇒ derived ½·m·r² from authored mass+radius) |
//! | peak axle torque | MOTOR `lunco:motor:stallTorque` x gearbox `ratio` x `efficiency` | via motor |
//! | no-load axle speed | MOTOR `lunco:motor:noLoadSpeed` / gearbox `ratio` | via motor |
//! | bearing damping | `physxVehicleWheel:dampingRate` | yes |
//! | brake torque | `physxVehicleWheel:maxBrakeTorque` | yes |
//! | slip stiffness | `physxVehicleTire:longitudinalStiffness` | yes |
//! | Coulomb μ | `lunco:tire:frictionCoefficient` | yes |
//! | grip stiffness | `lunco:wheel:contactGripStiffness` | yes |
//! | drive force/normal | `lunco:wheel:driveForcePerNormal` | yes |
//! | steer axis | `lunco:wheel:steerAxis` | yes |
//! | motor damping | `lunco:wheel:driveDamping` | yes |
//! | stall torque gain | `lunco:wheel:stallTorqueGain` | yes |
//! | suspension | `lunco:suspension:restLength` + `physxVehicleSuspension:springStrength`/`:springDamperRate` | raycast only |
//!
//! ## One no-load speed for both realizations
//!
//! `physxVehicleEngine:maxRotationSpeed` is THE no-load axle speed, and both
//! kinds obey it: the joint wheel's velocity motor targets it
//! (`MotorActuator::max_omega`), and the raycast wheel rolls its drive force
//! off toward it (`lunco_mobility::drive_force_mag`), so both self-limit at
//! `ω_max · r`. There used to be a second name for the same quantity —
//! `lunco:wheel:maxDriveOmega`, read only by the joint path — and the two were
//! authored 60 vs 12, which is why raycast rovers drove ~5× too fast. The
//! second name is GONE; there is no alias and no fallback.
//!
//! ## Strictness
//!
//! NO Rust fallback values. Every required attribute missing from the composed
//! prim is an asset error, collected so one bad wheel reports ALL of them, not
//! just the first. The authored defaults live in
//! `components/mobility/wheel.usda`, which every wheel composes — one authored
//! set is what makes "same defaults for both variants" true.
