//! # LunCoSim USD → Simulation Mapping
//!
//! Detects USD simulation schemas (NVIDIA PhysX Vehicles) and maps them to LunCoSim
//! simulation components. This is the **third** plugin in the USD processing pipeline,
//! running after `UsdBevyPlugin` and alongside `UsdAvianPlugin`.
//!
//! ## Detected Schemas
//!
//! | USD Schema | LunCoSim Components | Description |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `PhysxVehicleContextAPI` | `FlightSoftware` | Rover root entity (kind is topology-derived, no `RoverVessel` marker) |
//! | `PhysxVehicleTankDifferentialAPI` | `DriveMix { kernel: "skid" }` | Skid/tank steering |
//! | `PhysxVehicleAckermannSteeringAPI` | `DriveMix { kernel: "linear" }` + steering port | Ackermann steering |
//! | `lunco:driveMix` (string) | `DriveMix { kernel: "linear" }` | Arbitrary per-wheel linear mix |
//! | `lunco:driveKernel` (hook id) | `DriveMix { kernel: <hook_id> }` | Scripted (rhai) drive kernel — hook computes per-port outputs |
//! | `PhysxVehicleWheelAPI` | `WheelRaycast` *or* `MotorActuator` + `RigidBody` | Wheel — kind decided by joint authoring |
//!
//! ## Wheel kind: discriminated by standard authoring
//!
//! No custom `lunco:` tokens. Each `PhysxVehicleWheelAPI` wheel becomes:
//!
//! - **Joint-based** if any `def PhysicsRevoluteJoint` in the stage targets
//!   it via `rel physics:body1`. Motor torque comes from the joint's
//!   `drive:angular:physics:maxForce` (`UsdPhysicsDriveAPI:angular`); the
//!   constraint is built by `lunco-usd-avian`. The wheel becomes a full
//!   rigid body with collider and `MotorActuator`.
//! - **Raycast** otherwise. The wheel entity is split into a physics
//!   entity (identity rotation, `RayCaster::new(Dir3::NEG_Y)`) plus a
//!   visual child carrying the cylinder rotation.
//!
//! ## Wheel Entity Splitting (Raycast Only)
//!
//! USD defines each wheel as a **single entity** with a mesh and a rotation (90° Z for
//! wheel orientation). However, LunCoSim's raycast wheels need two entities:
//!
//! 1. **Physics entity** — identity rotation so `RayCaster::new(Dir3::NEG_Y)` casts
//!    straight down (local space). If rotated, rays go sideways and hit the chassis.
//! 2. **Visual child entity** — 90° Z rotation + mesh so the cylinder renders as a
//!    rolling wheel (not a flat pancake).
//!
//! The `process_usd_sim_prims` system performs this split at runtime for raycast wheels.
//! Physical wheels keep the USD entity as-is (mesh + rotation are correct for rendering).
//!
//! ## Why Deferred Processing?
//!
//! The `On<Add, UsdPrimPath>` observer fires when the entity is spawned, but the USD
//! asset may not be loaded yet (async loading). The `process_usd_sim_prims` system runs
//! in the `Update` schedule **after** `sync_usd_visuals` to ensure:
//! 1. The USD asset is fully loaded
//! 2. Meshes exist so we can split wheel entities into physics + visual
//! 3. No duplicate processing or duplicate FSW ports

/// Plugin for mapping simulation-specific USD schemas (like NVIDIA PhysX Vehicles)
/// to LunCo's optimized simulation models.
///
/// # Processing Order
///
/// 1. `process_usd_sim_prims` — maps schemas to components (runs after sync_usd_visuals)
/// 2. `try_wire_wheel` — connects wheel drive ports to FSW digital ports
///
/// The observer `on_add_usd_sim_prim` intentionally does minimal work. All processing
/// is deferred to the `process_usd_sim_prims` system to ensure assets are loaded first.
///
/// # Wheel kind dispatch (no custom schemas)
///
/// Each wheel prim with `PhysxVehicleWheelAPI` becomes either a raycast wheel
/// (suspension simulation) or a joint-based wheel (full rigid body + revolute
/// joint), discriminated entirely by **standard OpenUSD authoring**:
///
/// - If any `PhysicsRevoluteJoint` in the stage targets the wheel via its
///   `physics:body1` rel → joint-based path. Motor torque comes from the
///   joint's `drive:angular:physics:maxForce` (`UsdPhysicsDriveAPI:angular`).
///   The joint constraint itself is built by `lunco-usd-avian`.
/// - Otherwise → raycast path.
///
/// No custom `lunco:` tokens drive this dispatch.
/// Marker resource present **only** on a headless build with no GPU renderer
/// (the `--no-ui` server). Visual components (`Mesh3d`, and especially the
/// shader-pipeline `ShaderMaterial`) are produced by render-side systems that
/// don't run without a renderer, so any setup that *waits* for them would block
/// forever headless. [`process_usd_sim_prims`] consults this so the rover's
/// raycast-wheel **physics** (drivetrain, ports, ray-casters) is built without a
/// renderer — otherwise the authoritative headless server can never simulate or
/// replicate a drivable rover (wheels stay deferred → no `WheelRaycast` → frozen
/// rover). Absent on GUI builds, where the visuals do arrive and the wait is
/// correct (keeps the wheel's shader material on the split visual child).
