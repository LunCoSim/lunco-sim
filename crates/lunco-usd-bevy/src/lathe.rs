//! Parametric lathes: a `UsdGeomNurbsPatch` that keeps its DEFINITION on the
//! entity and regenerates its `Mesh` when that definition changes.
//!
//! ## Why the definition is retained
//!
//! Tessellating a patch at load and discarding its definition leaves nothing
//! downstream able to see what the surface IS, only what it was tessellated into.
//! Two things follow:
//!
//! - **Nothing can edit it.** The scripting bridge reflects COMPONENTS, so with no
//!   component `set(me, "NurbsPatch.points", pts)` fails with `unknown type
//!   'NurbsPatch'`. The only reach left is a per-frame actuator re-lathing the patch
//!   every tick — wasted work (a nozzle's shape does not change while the engine
//!   burns) and an error thrown 25×/second that masks every other scenario error.
//! - **The shape gets authored twice.** A bell carrying literal control points AND a
//!   `LunCoProgram` whose `inputs:` say what the bell is — throat, exit, length,
//!   contour — has two spellings of one shape, free to disagree: a drawn contour
//!   exponent of ≈1.3 (a flaring cone) against a declared 0.55 (a real bell).
//!   Making that disagreement observable is a tripwire, not a fix. Deriving the
//!   control net from the profile is the fix.
//!
//! ## The shape
//!
//! [`NurbsSurface`] is the patch's definition, retained on the spawned entity and
//! change-detectable. [`UsdLathe`] is the *parametric* layer above it: a named
//! profile plus its numbers. The pipeline is two hops, each gated on `Changed`:
//!
//! ```text
//!   UsdLathe  ──Changed──►  NurbsSurface  ──Changed──►  Mesh
//!  (parameters)            (control net)              (triangles)
//! ```
//!
//! Both hops are writable from a script, because both are real reflected
//! components:
//!
//! ```text
//!   set(id, "UsdLathe.profile.exit_radius", 1.6)   // re-lathes, then re-meshes
//!   set(id, "NurbsSurface.points", [[x,y,z], ...]) // re-meshes only
//! ```
//!
//! Neither system runs on an unchanged entity — that is the whole point, and it is
//! enforced by the `Changed<T>` filters rather than by a dirty flag anyone can
//! forget to clear.
//!
//! ## Why the lathe evaluates HERE and not in Modelica
//!
//! `LunCo.Propulsion.BellNozzle` owns the ENGINEERING — expansion ratio, thrust
//! coefficient, Isp, thrust. It does not own the shape; it *consumes* the shape's
//! four numbers. Routing the drawn geometry through the solver would make a static
//! surface depend on a running simulation (and on solver step order at load), for a
//! quantity that is a closed-form function of parameters the USD already carries.
//!
//! So both sides evaluate the SAME LAW from the SAME AUTHORED NUMBERS:
//!
//! ```text
//!   r(s) = throat + (exit - throat) * s^contour ,  s = i / (rings - 1)
//! ```
//!
//! which is verbatim the model's own `r_station_1` / `r_station_2` definition
//! (stations at s = 1/3 and 2/3 — i.e. the 4-ring control net, spelled out). The
//! model's outputs stop being a tripwire for a mismatch that existed and become a
//! live cross-check that agrees by construction.
//!
//! ## What is preserved exactly
//!
//! The u-direction is the classic rational 4-arc circle — 9 control points, √2/2 on
//! the diagonals, doubled interior knots, order 3 — and is generated, not authored,
//! so it cannot drift. That is what keeps the exit rim and the dish edge genuinely
//! ROUND instead of an octagon. Dropping those weights turns a 0.58 m rim into a
//! 0.62 m bulge at the diagonals; see the rationality tests in [`crate::nurbs`].
