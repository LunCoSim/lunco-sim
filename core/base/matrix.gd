# Fields: gravitation, thermal, thermal flux, atmospheric resistance, e.t.c.
# Everything interacts with fields, fields interact with each other
# CFD is a field. 
# Fields can be local, meaning it's value is zero everywhere except finite space
# Fields can generate forces

# Avatars can connect to matrix
# Matrix can respond on requests, e.g. provide avater with all the objects 

# Common fields:
# - Gravitation field
# - Atmospheric field
# - Thermal field
# - Fossils field
# - Electric network/current field
# - Magnetic field
# - Radiation field

# Fields can be integrated and differinciated
