# Documentation

This is the main file that will store all the links to all the documentation file. 

Documentation is made with Obsidian, so some of the Markdown features could work differently on github.

| Doc name                                      | Brief description                                                     |

| [Useful SW on Godot](Useful-SW-on-Godot.md) | List of libs/projectds made with Godot that could be useful for LunCo |

## What to expect in professional mode

1. Database of materials (based on db like MAPTIS)
2. Database of components
3. Follow engineering procedures: PDR, CDR, Testing, Integration, Flight, Mission Operation
4. From first unmanned missions to sustainable human colony on the Moon
5. Keep track of your budgets: money, mass, power, data.
6. Thermal, power, communications management
7. Presize interface control description: physical, mechanical, power, data, logical, thermal
8. Supply chain
9. Logistics

### What to expect in game mode

1. Supply chain management as in Factorio
2. Robot & rocket control as in KSP
3. City management as in SimCity
4. Economics
5. Realistic technologies, physics and enviroment. E.g. you have to extract ~30-50 of different raw resources to build a satellite like Aluminum, Copper.
6. Hardware in the loop: integration with real hardware. Linux Kernel drivers integrated with sim showing sim date e.g. serial devices, PID controllers, etc. 


## Summary

LunCo is an open-source simulation tool designed for planning space missions, with a focus on lunar settlements. 

It's built with the Godot 4 engine and aims to revolutionize the way space engineers design and collaborate on complex systems. 

The platform provides a comprehensive suite of applications tailored for Lunar Base engineering, including a unified platform, requirements management, models visualizations, collaborative training, and digital twin simulations. 

LunCo has a strong web3 component, incorporating decentralized technologies to enable features such as collaborative mission design in a metaverse, intellectual property non-fungible tokens (IP-NFTs) for designs, and decentralized engineer profiles. This allows for a secure, transparent, and community-driven approach to space engineering and design.
