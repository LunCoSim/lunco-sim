# What LunCo is?

1. LunCo is a virtual universe where you can design space missions interactively.
2. It works with existing software like GMAT for calculating orbits.
3. It follows the standards set by NASA, ESA, and OMG.
4. You can work on missions together with others in real-time.
5. It's free and open-source, built on the Godot game engine.


# The Real-World Challenges of Space Engineering

1. Diverse software, diverse standards
2. Open-source standards like STEP for 3D models are used, but interoperability is often missing
3. Email chains and multiple versions of files can slow down progress

# How it’ll work with LunCo?

1. Engineers open LunCo
2. They have access to all the useful tool e.g. requirement management, engineering, models
3. They start with a blank world/simulation and add components and rules to the world using pre-build solutions or through AI help
4. The data is distributed in a decentralized p2p manner - relying on public infrastructure
5. The world/simulations “are alive”, integrated with real-world sensors
6. All the models are uploaded from existing software into “live” universe and shared using web3 tool, including role system to control access rights

# How Decentralized technologies are used in LunCo?

1. Data exchange via decentralized services like IPFS/Filecoin
2. IP-NFT to show ownership and make it easier to discover

# LunCo Roadmap

1. Binary build - end of oct 2023
2. Q2 2024 - decent version to start design robotic lunar exploration missions together
3. Q4 2024 - Launch of Metaverse, extensive building of tool funded by refi activities, e.g. quadratic funding round
