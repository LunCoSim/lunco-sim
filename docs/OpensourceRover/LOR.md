# Lunar Opensource Rover (LOR) Specification

## Version 0.1
**Status:** Draft Specification  

## 1. Overview

The Lunar Opensource Rover (LOR) specification defines a standardized, modular platform for lunar surface exploration vehicles. Similar to the CubeSat standard for small satellites, LOR provides a common framework that enables rapid development, testing, and deployment of lunar rovers through standardized interfaces, dimensions, and subsystems.

### 1.1 Objectives
- **Standardization**: Create a common platform for lunar rover development
- **Modularity**: Enable plug-and-play component integration
- **Composability**: Support various mission configurations
- **Open Source**: Foster collaborative development and innovation
- **Cost Reduction**: Minimize development time and costs through standardization
- **Interoperability**: Ensure components from different manufacturers work together

### 1.2 Scope
This specification covers:
- Physical dimensions and form factors
- Mechanical interfaces and mounting systems
- Electrical power and data interfaces
- Communication protocols
- Standard subsystem definitions
- Environmental requirements
- Testing and validation procedures
