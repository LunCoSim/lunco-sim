# Basics of efficient global coordination: Web3 for Begginers Crash Course: From Basics to Advanced Concepts

This crash course will introduce you to key concepts and practical knowledge to help you navigate the Web3 Space.

## Basic Concepts

1. Blockchain/DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology)
    - A decentralized, transparent, and immutable digital ledger
    - Records transactions across multiple computers

2. Cryptocurrency
     - Digital or virtual currencies built on blockchain technology

3.Web3
     - Communities on top of crypto
     - Enables user ownership and control of data and digital assets

4. Blockchain Ecosystems
     - Various blockchains exist with different properties and purposes
     - Each has its own community and use cases (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot)

5. Cryptography Basics
    - Private keys: Secret codes that prove ownership and allow transactions
    - Public keys: Derived from private keys, used to receive funds
    - Addresses: Shortened versions of public keys for easier use

6. Wallets
    - Software or hardware tools to interact with blockchain e.g. send currencies
    - Browser wallets e.g. Metamask

7. Gas Fees
    - Transaction costs paid in a blockchain's native token
    - Compensates network validators for processing transactions

8. Tokens and Utilities
    - Cryptocurrencies built on existing blockchains (e.g., ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum)
    - Can represent various assets or utilities like voting rights in DAOs

9. Interaction with wallet:
   - Seed phrase
   - Connect to website
   - sign message
   - execute transaction 

## Advanced Concepts

1. Layer 2 Solutions (L2s)
     - Built on top of existing blockchains to improve scalability and reduce fees
    - Examples: Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon

2. Multisignature Wallets (Multisigs)
    - Require multiple signatures to authorize transactions
    - Enhance security and enable shared control of funds

3. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Basics
    - Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): Trade cryptocurrencies without intermediaries
    - Bridges: Transfer assets between different blockchains
    - token allowance/revoking with Revoke.cash 

4. Advanced DeFi
    - Lending protocols: Borrow or lend cryptocurrencies
    - Liquidity pools: Provide assets to DEXs and earn rewards

5. Public Goods
   - Platforms for donations and grants in cryptocurrency
   - Examples: Gitcoin, Giveth, Octant

6. DAOs and Coordination
    - Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
    - Community-led entities with shared treasuries and decision-making

7. Quadratic voting/funding, and other voting mechanisms e.g. conviction voting

## Practical Tips

1. Fiat-Crypto Conversion (On/Off Ramps)
     - How to buy cryptocurrencies with traditional money and vice versa

2. Living on Crypto
    - Services accepting crypto payments: hotels, flights, transportation, food
    - Crypto debit cards for everyday purchases

3. Safety and Security
    - Always double-check addresses before sending funds
    - Use hardware wallets for long-term storage of significant amounts
    - Be wary of phishing attempts and too-good-to-be-true offers

## Conclusion

Remember, the Web3 space is rapidly evolving. Stay curious, keep learning, and always do your own research (DYOR) before making any financial decisions.
