# Web3 Native Lunar Settlement

## Intro

The goal of the course is to prepare a group of trained lunar rovers/robotics operators. 

The course is divided into Several parts:
1. [Part One: Theoretical aspects of running a rover on the Moon](./PART_ONE_BASIC_OF_LUNAR_MISSIONS.md)    
2. [Part Two: Basics of efficient global coordination: web3 for begginers](./PART_TWO_WEB3_FOR_BEGGINERS.md)
3. [Part Three: Lunar Rover Operator Training](./PART_THREE_LUNAR_ROVER_OPERATOR_TRAINING.md)

The first two parts are mostly theoretical, and could be self-studied, while the third part should be done in groups.

During the course we will split into several groups:
1. One team playing for as a lander team
2. Several teams playing for rovers

We will train how to run missions when on one lander several rovers all across the globe presented. How we will make sure that we wont make the first BattleBots on the Moon?
