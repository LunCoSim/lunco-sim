## How it Works

LunCo combines the power of space engineering with the accessibility of gaming and the innovation of Web3:

1. **Mission Creation**: Users design lunar missions using our intuitive interface, selecting from a variety of assets (rovers, habitats, power systems) represented as NFTs

2. **Simulation**: simulates mission scenarios in real-time, accounting for lunar gravity, terrain, and other space environment factors focusing on system-level effects

3. **Collaboration**: Engineers and enthusiasts worldwide can join forces in multiplayer mode, sharing ideas and solving complex problems together

4. **Web3 Integration**: 
   - Login seamlessly with MetaMask
   - Use NFTs to share missions, assets, or features

5. **Learn and Iterate**: Analyze mission results, refine your designs, and contribute to a growing knowledge base of lunar engineering solutions

6. **Community Engagement**: Participate in challenges, workshops, and competitions to push the boundaries of lunar settlement design



## Why Web3?

Web3 technology allows decentralization, which is crucial as engineering work is often dispersed across various teams. 

The most common approach to knowledge sharing is email, which, while universal, is not the most efficient form of data exchange in today's digital age. On the other hand, Web3 provides advanced tools for file sharing and data exchange.
