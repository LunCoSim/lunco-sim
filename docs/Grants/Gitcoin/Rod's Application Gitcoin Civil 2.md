# Project

Hi, my name is Rod Mamin. I'm **space systems engineer** holding masters degree in Math & CS.

I've joined Gitcoin with my project LunCo on the last days of the GR14, thou my first real round was GR15/DeSci.

Since that I've being promoting Gitcoin, QF, and ReFi among space professionals. 

I've worked on the walking rover for the Moon that  has to be launched on the Peregrine Lander.

I'm a huge fan of OSS (FYI I'm using Linux)

I believe that Space Exploration must be democratized and Gitcoin and related activities are the first real opportunity to do that!
# Application

If you have work completed, please describe it below and include links where possible:

1. I've hosted and Stewarded Gitcoin Radio on Beta round
2. I've jumped to host Radio during GG18 when hosts were missing, sometimes for several hours 
3. I've being one of team members who brought [$25k  from MoonDAO for DeSci Beta round ](https://snapshot.org/#/tomoondao.eth/proposal/0x0884cb2b0908cd74f9f97ee48d792990ff2f5b994474d4aec83f9c490838f09c)
4. I'm one of the founding stwards of DeSpace QF - the goal is to onboard space engineers into refi by running Featured Round on Gitcoin for Decentralized Space Exploration projects


If you have work you are planning to do, please describe it below and include estimates of how much time (in hours) you expect it will take

To make DeSpace QF round happen a lot of things has to be done: grantee onboarding, promotion, and of course fundraising. It's an ongoing job, and I'm spending on it ~25% of my time.
