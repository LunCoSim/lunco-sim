LunCo addresses **Real World issue of Space Engineers** but in a web3 way. At it's core LunCo is an opensource simulation tool to plan Space missions, ultimately - Settlement on the Moon.

Engineers would be able to design the missions in the metaverse and share it with using web3 tools, like issuing IP-NFT for the published design.

Such a tool would not only decrease the cost of space missions, but also will **onboard space engineers into web3**, literally bring crypto beyond Earth Orbit.

**Decentralized engineer's profile could be tied to ENS name** and used for access management e.g. sharing the design with certain ENS names.

LunCo is supported by regen community on [Giveth.io]([https://giveth.io/project/lunco-collaborative-engineering?referrer_id=0hWfCeRLhwayen8MGBaZGP0CLZv1](https://t.co/YxIG7o0Lii)) and participated on Gitcoin GR15 DeSci, Alpha Round OSS, Beta Round DeSci, and GG18 OSS rounds, and **overall raised ~$30k**

The first collaborative exploration of Langrenus crater already happened, binary build is expected in 2-4 weeks.
