## Why Web3?

Web3 technology allows decentralization, which is crucial as engineering work is often dispersed across various teams. 

The most common approach to knowledge sharing is email, which, while universal, is not the most efficient form of data exchange in today's digital age. On the other hand, Web3 provides advanced tools for file sharing and data exchange.

## Impact

Through LunCo, we aim to:

- Lower engineering costs, by making knowledge sharing much more efficient
- Democratize the engineering landscape, providing equal access to manufacturing software for all.
- Foster a global engineering community encouraging data and technology transfer across domains.
- Serve as a repository of high-quality data for engineering AI.

## Roadmap & Features

### Work in progress

1. Real sized map of the Moon based on NASA Data. Working on Procedure Quad Sphere to make it possible
2. Visualization of the upcoming lunar missions
3.  Import of URDF files - widely used format for robots description

### Next steps

1. Assets e.g. models sharing via IPFS and libp2p
2. Integration with wallets
3. User content discovery via  IP-NFT
4. Tools for permissions management, allowing to share content only with selected profiles
5. And much more. Follow our Discussions on Github.

### Sample applications

- Design solar power station in space 
- Assess impact of solar panels in the specific project
- Plan satellite constellations 
- Visualize robotic transportation system
- Monitoring and controlling of remote agriculture robots
- Model Closed Loop Biological Life Support Systems

# Application specific questions:

**Please explain how your project meets the round-specific eligibility criteria**

LunCo leverages Web3 technology to provide a platform that helps engineers share information directly without bottlenecks, particularly:

- Assets and Design sharing over IPFS
- IP-NFT for design
- Decentralized users profile for permissions management


**If you've participated in past grant rounds, please share any new updates or milestones from the prior months**


1. Launched public server, so now you can start design missions and explore together. Huge thx to [Philip Linden](https://twitter.com/PhilipJLinden)
2. Contributed to Godot ecosystem, making several pull requests
3. Was accepted to Giveth Alpha QF Round
4. Selected GMAT for orbital mechanics engine after comparing with Basilisk. GMAT is an opensource tool by NASA for satellite mission planning with a quality -  TRL-9, meaning it was used for real space missions. 
5. Attended several [LSIC](https://lsic.jhuapl.edu) meetings to verify problems, that professionals has working on Lunar Missions. Those guys are connected to Artemis Accords!
6. Reviewed [NASA Celestial mapping system](https://celestial.arc.nasa.gov) and was contacted by one of it's developers, offering help
7. Started to use [Github Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/LunCoSim/discussions) to discuss features
8. [NASA is Looking for Constellations Analysis Tools ](https://sam.gov/opp/afe50c193c8140a7a1a64878b3d69df4/view) providing projects with grants up to $800k. However  it's only for the US companies and US citizen
9. [Almost won ENS Small Public Grant with 13 place](https://ensgrants.xyz/rounds/27) (first 10 got 1 ETH), a huge chance that will get it the next time

**How do you measure the impact of your project? Please provide examples and/or standard metrics. This might be used in future impact reports**

1. Number of people onboarded to crypto, e.g. space engineers became donors/users of LunCo
2. Number of people onboarded to space exploration
3. Number of users of LunCo
4. Number of issued IP-NFTs
5. Number of articles about Lunar Exploration that mentions LunCo
6. Number of projects used LunCo in their design

**Anything else you'd like to share about your project, previous work, or other project affiliations? Anything you'd like to add that may help in determining project eligibility?**

Hey, it's Rod Mamin, founder of LunCo. I'm professional space systems engineer, quite active in the Gitcoin, Regen, Giveth, MoonDAO, DeSci, Solarpunk Guild, and DeSpace communities.
