Opensource Space Exploration | Everyone Can Do Space

Desciption

LunCo was started two years ago as opensource software for space missions design with the goal to use web3 mechanics to onboard space engineers into web3.

Half a year ago we released the first decent alpha version that is available at [https://alpha.lunco.space](https://alpha.lunco.space) and binary build at [Download Dev Build](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim/releases/tag/v0.4.0-dev1)

Now LunCo has grown, and we have several interconnected subprojects:

1. **LunCoSim** - the core technology used to design space missions. Now It's being reimagined with the focus on using opensource/openweight AI/LLMs to design space mission
2. **Lunar Opensource Lander (LOL)** - the first opensource lander in the world. The project is at it's early stage, and now we are mostly working on engaging experienced. 
3. **HyperDeSci** - an initiative to explore new ways to fund Decentralized Science projects, we already have run two QF rounds on Gitcoin

## LunCoSim


The core technology used to design space missions. Now It's being reimagined with the focus on using opensource/openweight AI/LLMs to design space mission. 

The repository with the source code is available [here](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim)

The below diagram highlights the overall idea.

LunCo is focused on **Data Sovereignty**, meaning that there is no need for central server. Users can run it locally, use it to edit their project, and then share it with the community using IP-NFTs for data discoverability, and decentralized data exchange networks like IPFS to share data itself.

The main subsystems are:

1. OS AI Space Engineer
2. Solar Power Energy Subsystems
3. Networking Subsystem
4. Requirements Management Subsystem
5. Model Based Systems Engineering Subsystem
## Lunar Opensource Lander (LOL)

The ultimate goal is to create a technology that would allow to manufacture tens of thousands of Lunar Landers in Garages to foster Lunar Exploration

The project is at it's early stage. We are working on partnership with organizations that has relevant experience, as well as definig the approach.

In principle there are two main approaches:

1. Top Down - design the Lander using as much as possible existing, probably proprietary subsystems
2. Bottom Up - design everything from scratch using only opensource technologies, starting with RISK V based flight computer

We are thinking to use combined approach, when the overall design is made Top Up, and then we will upgrade proprietary subsystems into OS alternative, that we developed.

## HyperDeSci 

We have run two QF rounds on Gitcoin,  below is the data from the first round, the results of the second round yet to be processed.

Soon we are planning to launch a test with Streaming QF for DeSci projects
