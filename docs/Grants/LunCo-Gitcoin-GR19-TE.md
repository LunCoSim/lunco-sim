_**Sovereign Metaverse for collaborative engineering**_

## [Download Dev Build](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim/releases/tag/v0.4.0-dev1)

The goal of LunCo is to integrate Space & Robotics industry existing models into one Virtual World, allowing collaborative (concurrent) engineering.

While focused on Space Engineering, it's not limited to it. With Godot as a 3D engine, it's **easy to add new functions and models, e.g. plan Solar Power Station parameters,** and concept of operations, e.g. how often to clean panels.


The funds from this particular grant would be used to tokens modeling support in LunCo opening ways to model complex systems in scenarios like:
1. Solar panel produces energy, tokens are issued based on that
2. Tokens could be ussued for different activites, like collecting lunar dust
3. With that capability user would be able to model different effects of tokenomics in virtual world

Such a capability to model tokenomics in LunCo could be for interactive token engineering, and modeling complex systems up to a city scale, teaching TE in a fun and engaging way


The below diagram highlights the overall idea.

LunCo is focused on **Data Sovereignty**, meaning that there is no need for central server. Users can run it locally, use it to edit their project, and then share it with the community using IP-NFTs for data discoverability, and decentralized data exchange networks like IPFS to share data itself.

## Why Web3?

Web3 technology allows decentralization, which is crucial as engineering work is often dispersed across various teams. 

The most common approach to knowledge sharing is email, which, while universal, is not the most efficient form of data exchange in today's digital age. On the other hand, Web3 provides advanced tools for file sharing and data exchange.

## Impact

Through LunCo, we aim to:

- **Lower engineering costs,** by making knowledge sharing much more efficient
- **Democratize the engineering landscape**, providing equal access to manufacturing software for all
- **Foster a global engineering community** encouraging data and technology transfer across domains
- Serve as a **repository of high-quality data for engineering AI**
