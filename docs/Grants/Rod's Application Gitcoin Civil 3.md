# Rod Mamin

Hi, my name is Rod Mamin. I'm Space Systems Engineer, founder of LunCo.

### DeSpace QF Steward

DeSpace stands for Decentralized Space Exploration, it was a [QF round for Space Exploration project run from November 14th till December 7th.](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/0x911ae126be7d88155aa9254c91a49f4d85b83688)

As one of the founding stewards I was responsible for marketing and grantee onboarding. 

Particularly I've onboarded (spend several hours with each projects on the call + spend some money on application fees, hope I didn't add projects I didn't onboarded, as it's hard to remeber):
1. [Ephemeris](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/0x911ae126be7d88155aa9254c91a49f4d85b83688/0) 
2. [Thrive on Mars](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/0x911ae126be7d88155aa9254c91a49f4d85b83688/21)
3. [Observer Space Station](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/0x911ae126be7d88155aa9254c91a49f4d85b83688/5)

5. [Orbuculum](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/0x911ae126be7d88155aa9254c91a49f4d85b83688/11)
6. [Agent-Based Model of Heterogeneous Lunar Networks](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/0x911ae126be7d88155aa9254c91a49f4d85b83688/3)

Being responsible for marketing I've spend my $250 and Paul Burg supported with his $250, in total $500 for DeSpace QF to be listed as Independent round on [grants.gitcoin.co](grants.gitcoin.co). Shoutout Jon from Spark for accepting [GTC on PGN for that!](https://explorer.publicgoods.network/tx/0x4169d89293c69f5c5b90df0e46079125bde9c3e1b73ce40eb1680238d855b0d0)

PS Shoutout to DeFi Teddy from [https://chaineye.tools/ ](https://chaineye.tools/) for adding the round to Chaineye rounds stats page!


## LunCo Ecosystem Support Round

On January 11 I've launched this round to experiment with different chains and LunCo's subprojects allowing community to decide what features to implement first. 

Initially the round was launched on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon, while later thx to Paul Burg (he found the TRUE GEM OF CHAINS WITH DONATIONS!!!!), it was launched on zkSync.

I think I'm the first one who have initiated the multichain experiment by running the simultaneously. 

After the first results that shown the system works, I've decided to scale the experiment and invited projects that somehow (but directly) were beneficial to LunCo's mission - settling the Moon.

#### Round Stats

1. [Optimism]( https://reportcards.gitcoin.co/10/0xc97d35206250092b1ec22299fa69f88ed171f0f7): $3420, 545 donors, 2579 donations
2. [Polygon]( https://reportcards.gitcoin.co/137/0xe03ebeb65bf0704f208bff15d994ea246d69b96c): $7857, 1970 donors, 14370 donations
3. [Arbitrum](https://reportcards.gitcoin.co/42161/0x18a72e9940fb81860a809e266ebec42a9e2c44ce): $2219, 382 donors, 1871 donations
4. [zkSync](https://reportcards.gitcoin.co/324/0xabdb3a90fd5678cc180734ea945514e9b2197ae9): $28160, 6734 donors, 26969 donations

**Total: $41656, 9631 donors, 45789 donations**

PS On this round I've raised some funds for GreenPill DeSpace chapter. This chapter is not super active yet, but the money are flowing
## HyperDeSci 

**[Join ROUND CHAT](https://t.me/hyperdesci_chat)** (44 members at the time of application)

The successful Ecosystem Round provided with resources and experience to run the round for DeSci projects (there were no DeSci round for almost a YEAR) - semicentralized QF round.

It's led by LunCo/me in order to move fast and do tons of experiments. I'm providing basic things:
1. Fundrasing for the round
2. Round management aka getting projects on the round and checking if they are DeSci
3. Post round Sybil analysis

Inititally grantees were concerned about running Multichain round, but now when donations comes on all the chains it seems like the community likes it. It would be really hard to conduct such an experiment without semicentralization


**Matching pool $6750:**
1. $5000 from LunCo
2. $1250 from EcoSynthesisX
3. $500 from Regen Design Agency

**Round stats (March 24, round ends on April 2, so will get more)**

**Total**: $2851 in donations, 946 donors, 4223 donations


## Decentralize! Space

I've also started Russian Speaking community to promote regen ideas, DeSci, DeSpace and Gitcoin where I'm sharing latest related news.

There are 62 subscribers [to the channel](https://t.me/despaceru) and [26 members on chat](https://t.me/despace_ruchat)

The plan is to onboard as much russian speaking members to regens ASAP


## Others

1. I've being sharing some bugs with Meg (SHE IS THE BEST, sorry for being too annoying from time to time), however it's hard to track it
2. I've started to put bugreports to Github:
	1. https://github.com/gitcoinco/grants-stack/issues/3071
	2. https://github.com/gitcoinco/grants-stack/issues/3072
	3. https://github.com/gitcoinco/grants-stack/issues/3073
	4. https://github.com/gitcoinco/grants-stack/issues/3070
3. Provided Umar with feedback that https://github.com/ufkhan97/regendata has no support of ZKSync

PS On March 28th I'll be shilling Gitcoin/Opensource/Public Goods and being Bankless to the US Immigration officer, by the time the rounds starts it's alredy would be done and I'll share the feedback with the community. 
Someone has to start doing it!
