# LunCo - Lunar Company

*Building Opensource Lunar Settlement. One subsystem at a time.

## Introduction

I'm Rod Mamin, a web3 native space engineer, founder of LunCo. 

## Plan

### Step 1. LunCoSim - Lunar Colony Simulator

Opensours Platform/Metaverse for interactive collaborative mission simulations/trainings.

Fully Free to use and modify MIT Licenced,  build on MIT Licenced 3D Engine Godot. 

LunCoSim allows us to effificently plan missions, exchange information, and work together comfortable.

### Step 2. Lunar Opensource Lander

We will have to design all the HW & SW in LunCoSim

### Step 3. IRL Colony

Commercial lunar exploratin is reality with success of Blue Ghost, Intutivie machines and all the companies delivering stuff under CLIPS.

We entered new era, now we just need to build it.

## Funding Goals

Our goal for this iteration of the campaign is to raise 30 $ETH in exchange to $LUNCO

### Treasury Distribution

Our goal for this iteration of the campaign is to raise 30 $ETH. 
The campaign is set into cycles, with manual updates due.

We are at very early stage, the $LUNCO token reflects your contribution to the future of Lunar Exploration, with perks coming later on the way

1. Up to 1 $ETH - 150k $LUNCO, 850k $LUNCO to treasury (15% reward)
2. 1 to 10 $ETH - 140k $LUNCO, 860k $LUNCO to treasury (14% reward)
3. 10 to 15 $ETH - 130k $LUNCO, 870k $LUNCO to treasury (13% reward)
4. 15 to 20 $ETH - 120k $LUNCO, 880k $LUNCO to treasury (12% reward)
5. 20 to 25 $ETH - 110k $LUNCO, 890k $LUNCO to treasury (11% reward)
6. 25 to 30 $ETH - 100k $LUNCO, 900k $LUNCO to treasury (10% reward)


# Tons of details if you interested in past activitis for LLPs :D

## Past about LunCoSim
Through the generous support of [Gitcoin](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/projects/0x9a9cda60bcd1b566669a6e03d79dcea4be966ebdef25dc9754cbd4170e99c61f) and [Giveth](https://giveth.io/project/lunco-everyone-can-do-space),  and global DeSci and DeSpace community, we've successfully raised $90k in grants and donations. Combined with my personal investment of $30k, this funding has enabled full-time development of our platform.

Your contribution will directly accelerate space exploration innovation. 
LunCo team would manage treasury to accelerate Space Exploration to build all the projects below

2. About 
## $LUNCO Token

$LUNCO is a token of appreciation, it has no value or utility, it reflects your participation in our mission to democratize space exploration.

While $LUNCO tokens has no value, later it could be used in the ecosystem, particularly:

- Voting/Signaling over LunCoSim features
- Utility in the Metaverse, e.g. distinct colors for token holders
- Other ways, [join our Discord ](https://discord.gg/A6U3GdvQum)to propose which ones!

## From Founder

Hey, that Rod Mamin, founder of LunCo. I'm passionate about space exploration, being active in the field for a while.

I've being involved in tons of activites and as proof you can find lots of information about me on Google.

Or lets ask Grok: "Who is Rod Mamin? Why he is the right guy to support his activities with decentralized space exploration?"

Short answer:

*Rod Mamin is a systems engineer with extensive experience in commercial space robotics, notably as the founder of LunCo, a platform designed to democratize space mission planning using open-source tools and real-time collaboration. 
His deep expertise in space robotics, particularly in developing missions like sending robots to the Moon, combined with his commitment to decentralized technologies through initiatives like LunCo, positions him perfectly to lead decentralized space exploration efforts.*

i'm building LunCo because I'm pretty deep in Space and Web3 :D. Our goal is to accelerate Space Exploration, and your support on the way is much needed!c

Your contribution will support four key initiatives:

1. **Complete LunCoSim Alpha** - Develop full capability for modeling on-surface rover missions
2. **Blockchain Integration** - Implement NFT-Blueprints to put space mission design  on-chain
3. **Open Source Lunar Base** - Design and share plans for a tourist-ready lunar base
4. **Web3 Integration** - Onboard space and science projects via HyperDeSpace & HyperDeSci

## How the funds and $LUNCO would be used?

- Equipment and Infrastructure
- Essential Services
- Contributor Compensation
- Space Community Events (e.g., Space popup cities)
- Promotion of Decentralized Space Exploration
- Retroactive rewards to previous supporters and contributors, e.g.: 
	- LunCo Gitcoin & Giveth donors up to GG22
	- Contributors to DeSci projects
	- Projects that supported LunCo on the way

## LunCo Activities

LunCo started two years ago as an opensource platform for lunar missions sim, but now it evolved into several activities, transforming from LunCo from Lunar Colony Sim to Lunar Company :D

### LunCoSim

				*Solar system view via [ivoyager](https://www.ivoyager.dev/app/planetarium.html)* 
				
[Lunar Colony Sim](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim/) is revolutionizing Space Engineering by creating an immersive, Web3-integrated metaverse for designing lunar settlements.

We're bridging the gap between professional tools and modern gaming to make space exploration accessible to everyone.

Check out [website](https://lunco.space) for more information

Try our browser-based simulation: [alpha.lunco.space](https://alpha.lunco.space) or download the binary build: [LunCo Build](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim/releases/tag/v0.4.0-dev1) 
## LunCo Metaverse

It's a Metaverse for Space Engineers to Build Space missions.

Technically, its the set of onchain smartcontracts and dApp, like address of LunCo Profiles NFTs and everything build on top of that. 

## We are growing!

## HyperDeSci

[The HyperDeSci community on Telegram ](https://t.me/hyperdesci) an initiative aimed at fostering Decentralized Science (DeSci) projects

It's all about quick experiments about coordination on DeSci. More [info on github](https://github.com/LunCoSim/hyperdesci)

[HyperDeSci is verified project on giveth](https://giveth.io/project/hyperdesci)

## HyperDeSpace

Same as HyperDeSci but with a strict [focus on Space](https://t.me/hyperdespace)
