# LunCo - Lunar Company

By donating to the project you are fostering open Space Exploration

## Intro

Hey all, 
It's Rod Mamin - founder of LunCo.

I'm crypto-native space engineer, being building opensource platform for Lunar Colony Simulation for the last two and a half years, and I need your help to scale the activity.

Thx  to [Gitcoin](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/projects/0x9a9cda60bcd1b566669a6e03d79dcea4be966ebdef25dc9754cbd4170e99c61f) and [Giveth](https://giveth.io/project/lunco-everyone-can-do-space), I've being able to bootstrap building of the sim, raising around $90k in grants and donations, and putting around $30k of my money into LunCo. 

That's helped a lot, allowing me to keep buidling fulltime

By donating to the project you are providing me with resources to accelerate Space Exploration.

To honor your contribution you'll get 10% of $LUNCO while the rest would be use to support upcoming activities. The token has no value or utility, it just reflects your contribution.

## My Background

Lets ask Groq: "Who is Rod Mamin? Why he is the right guy to support his activities with decentralized space exploration?"

Short answer:

*Rod Mamin is a systems engineer with significant experience in the field of space exploration, notably for his work in building and sending robots to the Moon. He is the founder of LunCo.Space and has been involved in various decentralized science and space exploration initiatives, including being a grantee in Gitcoin's decentralized science and open-source software grants rounds. Mamin's background in robotics and his role in fostering community-driven space projects make him a pivotal figure in the emerging field of decentralized space exploration.*

*His involvement in decentralized efforts like the DeSpace Quadratic Funding initiative showcases his commitment to democratizing space exploration. Decentralized space exploration aims to involve a broader community beyond traditional space agencies or corporate entities through blockchain technology, encouraging open-source development, collective decision-making, and crowdfunding. Rod Mamin's technical expertise combined with his focus on accessibility and community involvement positions him as an ideal candidate to lead and support activities that promote this new paradigm in space exploration, where the community has a stake in the outcomes and progress of space missions.*

## Activities

LunCo started two years ago as an opensource platform for lunar missions sim, but now it evolved into several activities, transforming from LunCo from Lunar Colony Sim to Lunar Company :D


### LunCoSim

[Lunar Colony Sim](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim/) is revolutionizing Space Engineering by creating an immersive, Web3-integrated metaverse for designing lunar settlements.

We're bridging the gap between professional tools and modern gaming to make space exploration accessible to everyone.

Try our browser-based simulation: [alpha.lunco.space](https://alpha.lunco.space) or download the binary build: [LunCo Build](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim/releases/tag/v0.4.0-dev1)

## HyperDeSci

[The HyperDeSci community on Telegram ](https://t.me/hyperdesci) an initiative aimed at fostering Decentralized Science (DeSci) projects

It's all about quick experiments about coordination on DeSci. More [info on github](https://github.com/LunCoSim/hyperdesci)

[HyperDeSci is verified project on giveth](https://giveth.io/project/hyperdesci)

## HyperDeSpace

Same as HyperDeSci but with a strict [focus on Space](https://t.me/hyperdespace)

## Decentralize! Space

Russian-speaking news channel [about DeSpace](@despaceru)

# Plans

1. Make LunCoSim a decent prototype to be able to model on-surface rover missions
2. Onboard more space projects into web3 via HyperDeSpace and science via HyperDeSci
3. Create opensource tourists lunar base

## How the funds will be used

1. Equipment
2. Services
3. Compensation to contributors
4. Supporting space-related activities, e.g. sponsoring Space popup cities
5. Promoting and building Decentralized Space Exploration
