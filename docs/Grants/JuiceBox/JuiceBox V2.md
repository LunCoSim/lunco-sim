# LunCo - Lunar Company

By donating to the project you are fostering Opensource Space Exploration

## Intro

Hey all, 
It's Rod Mamin - founder of LunCo.

I'm crypto-native space engineer, being building opensource platform for Lunar Colony Simulation for the last two and a half years, and I need your help to scale the activity.

Thx  to [Gitcoin](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/projects/0x9a9cda60bcd1b566669a6e03d79dcea4be966ebdef25dc9754cbd4170e99c61f) and [Giveth](https://giveth.io/project/lunco-everyone-can-do-space), I've being able to bootstrap building of the sim, raising around $90k in grants and donations, and putting around $30k of my money into LunCo. 

That's helped a lot, allowing me to keep buidling fulltime.

By donating to the project you are providing me with resources to accelerate Space Exploration.

To honor your contribution you'll get $LUNCO tokens. The token has no value or utility, it just reflects your contribution.

## My Background

Lets ask Grok: "Who is Rod Mamin? Why he is the right guy to support his activities with decentralized space exploration?"

Short answer:

*Rod Mamin is a systems engineer with extensive experience in commercial space robotics, notably as the founder of LunCo, a platform designed to democratize space mission planning using open-source tools and real-time collaboration. 
His deep expertise in space robotics, particularly in developing missions like sending robots to the Moon, combined with his commitment to decentralized technologies through initiatives like LunCo, positions him perfectly to lead decentralized space exploration efforts.*

# What we are raising for

1. Finish alpha version of LunCoSim to be able to model on-surface rover missions
2. Put Space Missions Design onchain via NFT-Blueprints
3. Design opensource tourists lunar base
4. Onboard space and science projects into web3 via HyperDeSpace & HyperDeSci
## Activities

LunCo started two years ago as an opensource platform for lunar missions sim, but now it evolved into several activities, transforming from LunCo from Lunar Colony Sim to Lunar Company :D

### LunCoSim

				*Solar system view will be implemented soon via [ivoyager](https://www.ivoyager.dev/app/planetarium.html)* 
				
[Lunar Colony Sim](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim/) is revolutionizing Space Engineering by creating an immersive, Web3-integrated metaverse for designing lunar settlements.

We're bridging the gap between professional tools and modern gaming to make space exploration accessible to everyone.

Try our browser-based simulation: [alpha.lunco.space](https://alpha.lunco.space) or download the binary build: [LunCo Build](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim/releases/tag/v0.4.0-dev1)   
## We are growing!

## HyperDeSci

[The HyperDeSci community on Telegram ](https://t.me/hyperdesci) an initiative aimed at fostering Decentralized Science (DeSci) projects

It's all about quick experiments about coordination on DeSci. More [info on github](https://github.com/LunCoSim/hyperdesci)

[HyperDeSci is verified project on giveth](https://giveth.io/project/hyperdesci)

## HyperDeSpace

Same as HyperDeSci but with a strict [focus on Space](https://t.me/hyperdespace)

## Decentralize! Space

Russian-speaking news channel [about DeSpace](@despaceru)

## How the funds will be used

1. Equipment
2. Services
3. Compensation to contributors
4. Supporting space-related activities, e.g. sponsoring Space popup cities
5. Promoting and building Decentralized Space Exploration
