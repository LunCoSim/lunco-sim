# LunCo - Democratizing Space Exploration Through Open Source

*Building the future of space exploration, one simulation at a time*

## Introduction

I'm Rod Mamin, a crypto-native space engineer and the founder of LunCo. For the past two and a half years, I've been leading the development of an open-source Lunar Colony Simulation platform that's revolutionizing how we approach space exploration.

Through the generous support of [Gitcoin](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/projects/0x9a9cda60bcd1b566669a6e03d79dcea4be966ebdef25dc9754cbd4170e99c61f) and [Giveth](https://giveth.io/project/lunco-everyone-can-do-space),  and global DeSci and DeSpace community, we've successfully raised $90k in grants and donations. Combined with my personal investment of $30k, this funding has enabled full-time development of our platform.

Your contribution will directly accelerate space exploration innovation. As a token of appreciation, contributors receive $LUNCO tokens â€“ while these tokens carry no monetary value or utility, they represent your part in our mission to democratize space exploration.

## My Background

Lets ask Grok: "Who is Rod Mamin? Why he is the right guy to support his activities with decentralized space exploration?"

Short answer:

*Rod Mamin is a systems engineer with extensive experience in commercial space robotics, notably as the founder of LunCo, a platform designed to democratize space mission planning using open-source tools and real-time collaboration. 
His deep expertise in space robotics, particularly in developing missions like sending robots to the Moon, combined with his commitment to decentralized technologies through initiatives like LunCo, positions him perfectly to lead decentralized space exploration efforts.*

I'm also involved in [Liberland Space program as an Advisor](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/16201208273473)

## Funding Goals

Your contribution will support four key initiatives:

1. **Complete LunCoSim Alpha** - Develop full capability for modeling on-surface rover missions
2. **Blockchain Integration** - Implement NFT-Blueprints to put space mission design  on-chain
3. **Open Source Lunar Base** - Design and share plans for a tourist-ready lunar base
4. **Web3 Integration** - Onboard space and science projects via HyperDeSpace & HyperDeSci

### Fund Allocation
- Equipment and Infrastructure
- Essential Services
- Contributor Compensation
- Space Community Events (e.g., Space popup cities)
- Promotion of Decentralized Space Exploration

### Treasury Distribution
- Until Nov 23, 23:59 UTC: 20% $LUNCO, 80% Treasury
- Until Nov 25, 23:59 UTC: 15% $LUNCO, 85% Treasury
- Thereafter: 10% $LUNCO, 90% Treasury

## Activities

LunCo started two years ago as an opensource platform for lunar missions sim, but now it evolved into several activities, transforming from LunCo from Lunar Colony Sim to Lunar Company :D

### LunCoSim

				*Solar system view will be implemented soon via [ivoyager](https://www.ivoyager.dev/app/planetarium.html)* 
				
[Lunar Colony Sim](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim/) is revolutionizing Space Engineering by creating an immersive, Web3-integrated metaverse for designing lunar settlements.

We're bridging the gap between professional tools and modern gaming to make space exploration accessible to everyone.

## HyperDeSci

[The HyperDeSci community on Telegram ](https://t.me/hyperdesci) an initiative aimed at fostering Decentralized Science (DeSci) projects

It's all about quick experiments about coordination on DeSci. More [info on github](https://github.com/LunCoSim/hyperdesci)

[HyperDeSci is verified project on giveth](https://giveth.io/project/hyperdesci)

## HyperDeSpace

Same as HyperDeSci but with a strict [focus on Space](https://t.me/hyperdespace)
