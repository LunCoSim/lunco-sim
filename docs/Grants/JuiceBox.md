## About

  LunCo (meaining Lunar Colony) was started two years ago as an opensource web3 software for space systems engineering with the focus on designing lunar colony.

  It was founded by [Rod Mamin](https://twitter.com/_Difint_). Before starting LunCo Rod worked for the company Spacebit as COO/senior systems engineer, where he was responsible for the development of the first walking rover for the Moon called [Asagumo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fko0VZNO8DM) and artwork by [Sacha Jaffri ](https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/art-in-space-sacha-jafri-dubai-spc-intl/index.html)

The artwork was successfully integrated on the Peregrine Lander by Astrobotics, and was launched to the Moon on Jan 8 2024.

With that experience Rod started LunCo to democratize space exploration, allowing anyone to plan the mission.

Alpha version of LunCo is available at [https://alpha.lunco.space](https://alpha.lunco.space)

The project is evolwing and now at LunCo we are working on AI Space Systems engineer, Lunar Opensource Lander, while developing LunCoSim as software to make it possible

We belive that space exploration is a right not a privilege and your help is crucial to make opensource space exploration

Space Exploration is the only thing that could unite humanity, provide enough resources for the sustainable future, and create millions of high skilled jobs

Now we have 4 people who works on the project, Rod, Miss Business Dev, Miss SMM, Mr Designer, with several contributors to the repository.

To move to the next stage we need funds, with one of the priority to hire SW developer fulltime

## Rewards

 Contributors will recive LunCo Profile NFTs, so all the activity in LunCoSim would be tight to it.

  With the grow of the project more and more features would be available to LunCo Profile NFT holders, including access to unique events, and ultimately sending it to the Moon
