## About

LunCo (from Lunar Colony) was started two years ago as an opensource web3 software for space systems engineering with the focus on designing lunar colony

***We believe that space exploration is a right not a privilege and your help is crucial to make opensource space exploration***

The project is evolving and now at LunCo we are working on [AI Space Systems engineer](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-chat-ai), [Lunar Opensource Lander](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunar-opensource-lander), while developing [LunCoSim](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim) as core software to make all the efforts possible

LunCo was founded by [Rod Mamin](https://twitter.com/_Difint_). Before starting LunCo Rod worked for the company Spacebit as COO/senior systems engineer, where he was responsible for the development of the first walking rover for the Moon called [Asagumo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fko0VZNO8DM) and artwork by [Sacha Jaffri ](https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/art-in-space-sacha-jafri-dubai-spc-intl/index.html)

The artwork was successfully integrated on the Peregrine Lander by Astrobotics, and was launched to the Moon on Jan 8 2024.

With that experience Rod started LunCo to democratize space exploration, allowing anyone to plan the mission.

Alpha version of LunCo is available at [https://alpha.lunco.space](https://alpha.lunco.space)

***Space Exploration is the only thing that could unite humanity, provide enough resources for the sustainable future, and create millions of high skilled jobs***


We have 4 people who works on the project, Rod, Miss Business Dev, Miss SMM, Mr Designer, Mr Sponsorship fundraiser with several contributors to the repository.

To move to the next stage we need funds, to hire full-time developers, get equipment, pay for services, and do business development.

## Details

We also explore web3-native ways to sustain space activities, like doing research how Token Engineering could be applied to space exploration, sharing designs like CAD files via IPFS, issuing IP-NFT for missions designs and so on

We have launched [HyperDeSci](https://github.com/LunCoSim/hyperdesci) to fund DeSci activities

LunCo was funded thx to generous donors on Gitcoin, Giveth, and raised ~$70k since it's launch in May 2022
## Subsystems / Subproject

- AI-based Space Systems Engineer
- Lunar Opensource Lander
- Solar Power Modeling 
- Model Based Systems Engineering
- Requirements Management
- [Decentralize! Space](https://t.me/despaceru)
- Token Engineering for Space Missions

## Rewards

 Contributors will receive LunCo Profile NFTs, so all the activity in LunCoSim would be tight to it.

  With the grow of the project more and more features would be available to LunCo Profile NFT holders, including access to unique events, and ultimately sending it to the Moon
