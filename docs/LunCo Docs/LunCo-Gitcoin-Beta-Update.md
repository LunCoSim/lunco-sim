### Technical

1. Now it's easy to add your content thx to new [modular architecture](obsidian://open?vault=LunCo%20Docs&file=LunCo%20architecture)
2. Start developing in minutes! Just [clone the repo](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim#installation) *(no more custom [package manager](https://github.com/LunCoSim/godot-package-manager))*
3. Updated to Godot 4, as it was finally released on March 1, 2023
4. Implemented [multiplayer](https://youtu.be/hxd3Y432irQ)

## About

LunCo is a single entry point with a nice UX into a rabithole of space engineering, fully open.

### Key Ideas

* Save engineers time with great UX
* Global database of engineering solutions
* Opensource, relies on open space standards

**Q: Why Godot 4?**

A: It's the only decent AAA opensource game engine.

**Q: How does LunCo help engineers?**

A: With a UX focused on saving time, integrated databases, a wide range of modules (CAD, CAE, ML, etc), and instant result sharing.

**Q: Why in web3?**

A: LunCo is designed on web3 concepts and principles, as one of the main goals is to connect engineers together in a decentralized manner and to serve as a web3 native toolkit for complex mission management.

A: All the code is under MIT licence. You can do what you want, even sell LunCo! Just leave the creds, please.

**Q: What standards do you plan to support?**

A: OMG, NASA, ESA, MOSA, CCSDS, etc.

**Q: Can you explain it as a professional space engineer?**

A: It is an all-in-one extendable modular tool with submodules for the following: requirements managements, MBSE, CE (concurrent engineering), project management (Kanban, Virtual whiteboard, diagrams, etc.), and build on decentralized technologies and open standards.

### Donations

**Q: Why should I donate?**

A: You will be part of helping to build a settlement on the moon.

**Q: How can I donate?**

A: Check the [Gitcoin Grantee Portal](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Gitcoin-Grantee-Portal-6adfc92627474bd48a5dfcd1e8438d20) for the latest news as well as [our project on Giveth](https://giveth.io/project/lunco-a-full-cycle-space-operations-sim-tool).

**Q: Why do I need a [Gitcoin Passport](https://passport.gitcoin.co/)?**

A: To prove that you are human to prevent bot attack on the system.

**Q: What if my Gitcoin Passport score is insufficient?**

A: Then your donation won't be eligible to raise funds for LunCo through the matching pool. However, our team could stake GTC for you, [reach Rod](https://twitter.com/_Difint_) for help.
