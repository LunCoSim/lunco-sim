# LunCo

_**Open-source software advancing industrial & robotics engineering for future Lunar Settlement**_

LunCo harnesses professional space engineers' expertise to create a project focusing on decentralized engineering. Its comprehensive toolkit caters to various hardware or robotics projects, making it an all-encompassing solution.

## The first public server is launched!

## Why Web3?

Web3 technology allows decentralization, which is crucial as engineering work is often dispersed across various teams. 

The most common approach to knowledge sharing is email, which, while universal, is not the most efficient form of data exchange in today's digital age. On the other hand, Web3 provides advanced tools for file sharing and data exchange.

LunCo leverages Web3 technology to provide a platform that helps engineers share information directly without bottlenecks, particularly:
- Assets and Design sharing over IPFS
- IP-NFT for design
- Decentralized users profile for permissions management

## Impact

Through LunCo, we aim to:

- Lower engineering costs, by making knowledge sharing much more efficient
- Democratize the engineering landscape, providing equal access to manufacturing software for all.
- Foster a global engineering community encouraging data and technology transfer across domains.
- Serve as a repository of high-quality data for engineering AI.


## Updates

1. Launched public server, so now you can start design missions and explore together. Huge thx to [Philip Linden](https://twitter.com/PhilipJLinden)
2. Contributed to Godot ecosystem, making several pull requests
3. Was accepted to Giveth Alpha QF Round
4. Selected GMAT for orbital mechanics engine after comparing with Basilisk. GMAT is an opensource tool by NASA for satellite mission planning with a quality -  TRL-9, meaning it was used for real space missions. 
5. Attended several [LSIC](https://lsic.jhuapl.edu) meetings
6. Reviewed [NASA Celestial mapping system](https://celestial.arc.nasa.gov) and was contacted by one of it's developers, offering help
7. Started to use [Github Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/LunCoSim/discussions) to discuss features
8. [NASA is Looking for Constellations Analysis Tools ](https://sam.gov/opp/afe50c193c8140a7a1a64878b3d69df4/view) providing projects with grants up to $800k. However  it's only for the US companies and US citizen

## Roadmap & Features

### Work in progress
1. Real sized map of the Moon based on NASA Data. Working on Procedure Quad Sphere to make it possible
2. Visualization of the upcoming lunar missions
3.  Import of URDF files - widely used format for robots description

### Next steps
1. Assets e.g. models sharing via IPFS and libp2p
2. Integration with wallets
3. User content discovery via  IP-NFT
4. Tools for permissions management, allowing to share content only with selected profiles
5. And much more. Follow our Discussions on Github.


### Sample applications

- Design solar power station in space 
- Assess impact of solar panels in the specific project
- Plan satellite constellations 
- Visualize robotic transportation system
- Monitoring and controlling of remote agriculture robots
- Model Closed Loop Biological Life Support Systems

## FAQ


**Q: The vision for LunCo is a multiplanetary, sustainable, solarpunk future. Agree?**

A: Wholeheartedly!

**Q: Why did we choose Godot 4?**

A: It's the most versatile open-source AAA game engine.

**Q: How does LunCo assist engineers?**

A: LunCo is an all-in-one toolkit designed to save the engineers' time with integrated databases, various modules(CAD, CAE, ML, etc.), and instant result sharing.

**Q: Why web3?**

A: Web3 principles facilitate decentralized collaboration between engineers and serve as a foundation for complex mission management.

**Q: Terms of usage of LunCo?**

A: You are free to use, modify, and even sell LunCo under the MIT license. We simply ask to acknowledge the source.

**Q: What standards does LunCo support?**

A: We aim to conform to the OMG, NASA, ESA, MOSA, CCSDS standards.

**Q: Can you explain it in layman space engineer terms?**

A: Consider it as an extendable tool kit that encompasses everything from requirements management, concurrent engineering (CE), project management tools (Kanban, virtual whiteboard), to support for open standards and decentralized technologies.

### Donations

**Q: Why donate?**

A: Be a part of our mission to establish a settlement on the moon!

**Q: How can I donate?**

A: Visit our [Gitcoin Grantee Portal](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Gitcoin-Grantee-Portal-6adfc92627474bd48a5dfcd1e8438d20) or [Project on Giveth](https://giveth.io/project/lunco-a-full-cycle-space-operations-sim-tool).
