## Project overview

***LunCo is an opensource collaborative engineering software for complex systems design inspired by Lunar Exploration and built by space systems engineers***

From solar panels, wind turbines, and vertical farms through solar power stations in space to permanent settlements on Moon and Mars - it's all about engineering.

Designing is hard and you need a lot of different software - CAD, CAE, CAM, FEA, MBSE, ERP, and so on.

Software that can operate complex systems like factories or Lunar Colony at all levels, a digital twin of the system - is crucial to run existing infrastructure. 

Lack of access to such software is a source of inequality in our world.

LunCo addresses these issues by providing an extensible core (3D, UI, web3-based data sharing), as well as a set of applications build on top of that for engineers.
