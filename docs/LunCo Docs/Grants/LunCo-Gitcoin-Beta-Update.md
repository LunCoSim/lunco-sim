# LunCo

***LunCo is an opensource collaborative engineering software for complex systems design inspired by Lunar Exploration and built by space systems engineers***

From solar panels, wind turbines, and vertical farms through solar power stations in space to permanent settlements on Moon and Mars - it's all about engineering.

Designing is hard and you need a lot of different software - CAD, CAE, CAM, FEA, MBSE, ERP, and so on.

Software that can operate complex systems like factories or Lunar Colony at all levels, a digital twin of the system - is crucial to run existing infrastructure. 

Lack of access to such software is a source of inequality in our world.

LunCo addresses these issues by providing an extensible core (3D, UI, web3-based data sharing), as well as a set of applications build on top of that for engineers.


## Impact

- significantly lower the cost of engineering, making not only Space Exploration more accesible, but in general the cost of engineered solutions, e.g. vertical farms
- lowering the barier to engineer stuff, providing everyone interested with equail access to manufacturing software
- global engineering community, data and technology transfer between domains
- source of high-quality data for engineering AI

### Technical

1. Now it's easy to add your content thx to new [modular architecture](obsidian://open?vault=LunCo%20Docs&file=LunCo%20architecture)
2. Start developing in minutes! Just [clone the repo](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim#installation) *(no more custom [package manager](https://github.com/LunCoSim/godot-package-manager))*
3. Updated to Godot 4, as it was finally released on March 1, 2023
4. Implemented [multiplayer](https://youtu.be/hxd3Y432irQ)

## About

LunCo is a single entry point with a nice UX into a rabithole of space engineering, fully open.

Check our [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@LunCoSim).  There (hopefully) should be an explanation video, launched right before the round.

### Key Ideas

* Save engineers time with great UX
* Global database of engineering solutions
* Opensource, relies on open space standards
* Reuse existing code for simulations, models, etc
* Integration with professional SW like Solidworks, Ansys, etc.
* A playground for Space Engineering AI

### Sample applications

- Design solar power station in space 
- Assess impact of solar panels
- Plan satellite constellations 
- Visualise robotic transportation system
- Monitor remote agricultire robots
- Model Closed Loop Biological Life Support Systems
- Build custom submodules for ERP, supply chain, CRM, etc

### Roadmap / next steps

1. Implement crucial PM tools: Kanban board, Infinite Whiteboard
2. User generated content distribution via IPFS
3. ReqIf - based requirements management
4. Basic models:
	1. Solar power generation
	2. Electricity consumption
	3. Air quality
	4. Thermal balance of a building
	5. Basic connectivity modeling
	6. Basic orbital mechanics (mostly to identify Sun position above the horizont at any given time)

### Donations

**Q: Why should I donate?**

A: You will be part of helping to build a settlement on the moon.

**Q: How can I donate?**

A: Check the [Gitcoin Grantee Portal](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Gitcoin-Grantee-Portal-6adfc92627474bd48a5dfcd1e8438d20) for the latest news as well as [our project on Giveth](https://giveth.io/project/lunco-a-full-cycle-space-operations-sim-tool).

**Q: Why do I need a [Gitcoin Passport](https://passport.gitcoin.co/)?**

A: To prove that you are human to prevent bot attack on the system.

**Q: What if my Gitcoin Passport score is insufficient?**

A: Then your donation won't be eligible to raise funds for LunCo through the matching pool. However, our team could stake GTC for you, [reach Rod](https://twitter.com/_Difint_) for help.
