# Space Mission Software overview


## Mission analysis SW

### GMAT

- Focused on orbital mechanics, not Lunar operations
- Advanced, but complicated
- Opensource, but development process is closed (double check)
- Standard and widely adopted

### STK

Proprietary mission analysis software

### FreeFlyer

Proprietary mission analysis software

### NASA Celestial Mapping System

Great tools for basic Lunar mission planning, kind of a Google Maps for Lunar Data. [Link](https://celestial.arc.nasa.gov)

## Frameworks

### BASILISK

- Highly rely on Python ecosystem
- Hard to model whole solar system
- Simulations are  build in Python, a free, but closed source program build on Unity only for visualizations
- A lot of great simulations of subsystems

### SPICE

Low-level library for orbital mechanics by NASA, widely adopted

### NASA Wildwind SDK

NASA SDK for Geospatial data

### IVoyager

Planetarium build on Godot, great starting point for solar system visualization

## Flight Software Frameworks

### Core Flight System

Opensource Software by NASA on C to run robots. Impressive flight heritage

### FPrime

Opensource Software by NASA on C++ to run robots. Tested on Ingenuity

## Games

### Kerbal Space Program

Well-known space missions game

### Factorio

Supply chain
