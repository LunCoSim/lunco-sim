# What is DeSpace

DeSpace is not rocket science. 95% of rev generated by space market comes from downstream services - launching stuff to space takes only 5% of the market.

DeSpace is an idea that web3 technologies could be used to optimize some precess in the space industry.

It starts with basic things:
1. Transactions between members of DeSpace community
2. Using web3 wallet to authenticate users in space services e.g. like Charmverse is a web3 alternative to notion.

With more people, space engineers, projects on board it'll open humanity access to unlimited resources of space! One small asteroid could contain more gold (or any element that we need) that we can get on Earth.

Space is much more than a trillion market, it's the only way for humanity to survive as species
