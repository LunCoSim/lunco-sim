# Coin Everything: Some considerations for founders 

Inspired by memecoins Zora pionered the idea of Coin everything and HyperStrucutres.

PumpDotFun Pionered idea of issuing coins for fun.

Tons of projects emerged from that and we are reviewing the mechanics.

We believe that coins is the evolution of donations when people resieve coins as token of appreciation for the projects support.

First, let's introduce the idea of coins. Coins are special tokens:
1. Instantly tradable via LPs
2. No intrinsic value like utility/governance
3. Small portion of coins could be dedicated to creators
4. Sometimes tax for trades are introduced
5. Tons of platforms with a focus on different projects/different audience.

We will review the mechanics of the following platforms:
1. Zora.co
2. Clanker: https://www.clanker.world
3. muse.markets
4. Origo.fun
5. https://streme.fun/
6. https://garden.taikai.network

## Types of coins

1. Memecoins
2. Art coins
3. Project coins

## How to Coin

1. Choose ticker
2. Choose starting market cap (or the price of your coin). The considerations - the smaller the cap the bigger portion of coins could be bought by you and people on free markets. It's a balance and consideration - how much X you want to make for you first supporters
3. Choose initial DevBuy
4. Airdrops? Better to make via claims so you won't drop to inactive accounts + more engagements with your posts
5. Token Vault - how much you reserve and for what?

## Awarness
1. Campaign on Galxe - but they'll dump your coin soon after
2. Buy coin (later get XX% of coins)
3Activity on X - reward contributors
