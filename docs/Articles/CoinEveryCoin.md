# Coin Everything: Considerations for Founders

Inspired by memecoins, Zora pioneered the idea of "Coin Everything" and HyperStructures.

PumpDotFun pioneered the concept of issuing coins for fun.

Many projects have since emerged, and in this article, we review their mechanics.

We believe that coins represent the evolution of donations, where people receive coins as a token of appreciation for supporting projects.

First, let's introduce the idea of coins. Coins are special tokens that:
1. Are instantly tradable via liquidity pools (LPs)
2. Have no intrinsic value, such as utility or governance
3. Can allocate a small portion to creators
4. Sometimes include a tax on trades
5. Are available on many platforms, each targeting different projects and audiences.

## Some of the examples

- [Zora.co](https://zora.co): A decentralized protocol and Layer 2 network on Ethereum, Zora enables creators to mint, distribute, and trade digital content and NFTs entirely on-chain. It features content coins, creator rewards, and a marketplace for trading and monetizing posts and media.
- [Clanker](https://www.clanker.world): Clanker is a set of audited smart contracts and tools for launching ERC-20 tokens on Base and Arbitrum. It allows users to deploy tokens instantly, configure liquidity and fees, and earn creator rewards based on trading volume. Integrates with Farcaster and offers advanced features for token creators. Clanker also provides a Farcaster botâ€”users can coin directly from a Farcaster post by tagging @clanker and specifying token details; the bot will automatically deploy the token and set up liquidity, making token creation accessible to anyone with a social post.
- [muse.markets](https://muse.markets): Muse Markets is a platform that funds and launches new crypto product ideas by turning them into tradable tokens. Ideas start as tweets and are launched as "Only Up" tokens, gathering trading fees into a pot. Community trading signals interest, and developers are incentivized to build the product, receiving the pot as compensation if the community approves the final result. Once built, the token transitions to traditional trading, aligning incentives for idea creators, traders, and builders, and fostering innovation in the crypto space.
- [Origo.fun](https://origo.fun): Origo is a permissionless platform focused on Decentralized Science (DeSci), enabling anyone to create their own token in just a few clicks, with no fees. Built on Base, Origo aims to unlock and capture scientific value by making token launches accessible to all, supporting early-stage research and innovation in science.
- [streme.fun](https://streme.fun): Streme is an AI agent-powered token launcher that deploys streamable tokens with built-in staking rewards and automatic Uniswap v3 liquidity provision. Tokens can be streamed in real-time (via Superfluid), and stakers earn rewards distributed continuously. Users can create Streme coins directly from Farcaster by mentioning @streme and providing token details. Each coin includes a staking contract with a reward pool, and creators earn a share of trading fees from the Uniswap pool.
- [garden.taikai.network](https://garden.taikai.network): Part of the TAIKAI hackathon ecosystem, the Garden is a collaborative space for nurturing and growing hackathon projects. It rewards innovation and collaboration, helping projects transition from ideas to thriving businesses within a vibrant community.
- [Onyx.bond](https://app.onyx.bond): Onyx is a protocol that enables businesses to tokenize their equity, creating a more liquid and efficient marketplace for business ownership. It streamlines the issuance of digital tokens representing business equity, offers integrated tools for vesting, OTC swaps, and liquidity (via Uniswap and Raydium), and provides on-chain governance and profit distribution. Onyx focuses on real business value, transparency, and investor protection, aligning token ownership with actual business performance.


## Types of Coins

*Note: All of these coins can be considered memecoins at their core, but some are so distinct or special in their purpose or community that it makes sense to recognize them as separate categories.*

1. Memecoins
   - Tokens inspired by internet culture, memes, or viral trends. They often have little or no intrinsic utility but can gain popularity and value through community engagement and social momentum.
2. Art coins
   - Tokens created to represent, fund, or trade digital art and creative works. These coins often support artists and provide access to exclusive content or experiences.
3. Project coins
   - Tokens launched to support specific projects, communities, or initiatives. They typically have no intrinsic value; their popularity is closely tied to the project's community and engagement. Project coins are sometimes used for rewards, and may gain utility or additional features as the project evolves. Importantly, they often function as a form of crowdfunding, helping to kickstart projects and support sustainability while the project provides value for free.

## How to Coin

1. **Choose a platform**
   - Select the platform that best fits your goals and audience (e.g., Zora, Clanker, Origo, Streme). Consider features, fees, and community reach.
2. **Choose ticker**
   - Pick a unique and memorable symbol for your coin.
3. **Choose starting market cap (or the price of your coin)**
   - The smaller the cap, the bigger portion of coins could be bought by you and early supporters. Balance your goals for distribution and initial value.
4. **Tokenomics design**
   - Decide on total supply, distribution, vesting schedules, and incentives. Consider if you want taxes/fees on trades and how rewards will be distributed.
5. **Legal & compliance considerations**
   - Understand the legal implications of launching a token, even for memecoins. Ensure you comply with relevant regulations in your jurisdiction.
6. **Smart contract deployment**
   - Most platforms handle this, but review or verify the contract if possible. Ensure transparency and security.
7. **Liquidity provision**
   - Provide initial liquidity for your coin, either manually or automatically (depending on the platform). This enables trading and price discovery. Most coin platform do that for you
8. **Airdrops & claims**
   - Consider distributing coins via claims rather than direct airdrops to inactive accounts. Claims increase engagement and awareness.
9. **Token vault/reserves**
   - Decide how much to reserve for future use, team, or community incentives, and communicate this clearly.
10. **Community building**
    - Set up social channels (X, Farcaster, Discord, Telegram, etc.), engage early supporters, and communicate your vision.
11. **Security best practices**
    - Protect admin keys, use multisig wallets where possible, and avoid common pitfalls. Prioritize transparency and user trust.
12. **Post-launch steps**
    - Monitor your coin, iterate on incentives, respond to community feedback, and adapt as needed to ensure long-term sustainability and growth.
