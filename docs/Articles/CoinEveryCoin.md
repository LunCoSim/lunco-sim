# Coin Every Coin


Inspired by memecoins Zora pionered the idea of Coin everything and HyperStrucutres.

PumpDotFun Pionered idea of issuing coins for fun.

Tons of projects emerged from that and we are reviewing the mechanics.


First, let's introduce the idea of coins. Coins are special tokens:
1. Instantly tradable via LPs
2. No intrinsic value like utility/governance
3. Small portion of coins could be dedicated to creators
4. Sometimes tax for trades are introduced
5. Tons of platforms with a focus on different projects/different audience.

We will review the mechanics of the following platforms:
1. Zora.co
2. Clanker: clank.fun, https://www.clanker.world
3. muse.markets
4. Origo.fun
5. https://streme.fun/
6. https://garden.taikai.network
