# Coin Everything: Considerations for Founders

Inspired by memecoins, Zora pioneered the idea of "Coin Everything" and HyperStructures.

PumpDotFun pioneered the concept of issuing coins for fun.

Many projects have since emerged, and in this article, we review their mechanics.

We believe that coins represent the evolution of donations, where people receive coins as a token of appreciation for supporting projects.

First, let's introduce the idea of coins. Coins are special tokens that:
1. Are instantly tradable via liquidity pools (LPs)
2. Have no intrinsic value, such as utility or governance
3. Can allocate a small portion to creators
4. Sometimes include a tax on trades
5. Are available on many platforms, each targeting different projects and audiences.

## Some of the examples

- [Zora.co](https://zora.co): A decentralized protocol and Layer 2 network on Ethereum, Zora enables creators to mint, distribute, and trade digital content and NFTs entirely on-chain. It features content coins, creator rewards, and a marketplace for trading and monetizing posts and media.
- [Clanker](https://www.clanker.world): Clanker is a set of audited smart contracts and tools for launching ERC-20 tokens on Base and Arbitrum. It allows users to deploy tokens instantly, configure liquidity and fees, and earn creator rewards based on trading volume. Integrates with Farcaster and offers advanced features for token creators. Clanker also provides a Farcaster botâ€”users can coin directly from a Farcaster post by tagging @clanker and specifying token details; the bot will automatically deploy the token and set up liquidity, making token creation accessible to anyone with a social post.
- [muse.markets](https://muse.markets): Muse Markets is a platform for trading and investing in digital assets, with a focus on luxury collectibles and investment-grade assets. It provides real-time valuations, expert curation, and a marketplace for high-value items such as art, watches, and more.

Tokens can be streamed in real-time (via Superfluid), and stakers earn rewards distributed continuously. Users can create Streme coins directly from Farcaster by mentioning @streme and providing token details. Each coin includes a staking contract with a reward pool, and creators earn a share of trading fees from the Uniswap pool.

Onyx focuses on real business value, transparency, and investor protection, aligning token ownership with actual business performance.


## Types of Coins

*Note: All of these coins can be considered memecoins at their core, but some are so distinct or special in their purpose or community that it makes sense to recognize them as separate categories.*

1. Memecoins
   - Tokens inspired by internet culture, memes, or viral trends. They often have little or no intrinsic utility but can gain popularity and value through community engagement and social momentum.
2. Art coins
   - Tokens created to represent, fund, or trade digital art and creative works. These coins often support artists and provide access to exclusive content or experiences.
3. Project coins
   - Tokens launched to support specific projects, communities, or initiatives. They typically have no intrinsic value; their popularity is closely tied to the project's community and engagement. Project coins are sometimes used for rewards, and may gain utility or additional features as the project evolves. Importantly, they often function as a form of crowdfunding, helping to kickstart projects and support sustainability while the project provides value for free.

## How to Coin

1. Choose ticker
2. Choose starting market cap (or the price of your coin). The considerations - the smaller the cap the bigger portion of coins could be bought by you and people on free markets. It's a balance and consideration - how much X you want to make for you first supporters
3. Choose initial DevBuy
4. Airdrops? Better to make via claims so you won't drop to inactive accounts + more engagements with your posts
5. Token Vault - how much you reserve and for what?

## Awarness
1. Campaign on Galxe - but they'll dump your coin soon after
