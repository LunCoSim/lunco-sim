# NFT Blueprints

Putting Space Mission design on chain.

## Abstract

Putting design on chain - ankoring it improves the efficiency of funds distribution. It's a form of specialised DeSci's IP-NFTs for Space Mission and Subsystems design.

The final goal is to summon a protocol for onchain design of Space Missions and Subsystems. 

That should results in a new market emergence, brbridging web3 into space industry and onboarding space engineers into web3.

## Implications

### Putting royalties on chain

NFT-blueprints can be used to put royalties on chain, taking the best from both worlds.

NFT could represent a patent or something similar, while binding legally ownership (actually a more complecx structures could emerage), and making royalties onchain.

NFT-blueprints as regular NFTs should store only metadata, like hashes and links to e.g. IPFS. 

NFT-blueprints could reference each other, creating chains of NFTs for value distribution, and reminding the way how spacecrafyts design based on Systems-subsystems-components approach.

NFT-blueprints could be utilized not just for Space missions, but for any robotic/hardware projects.

### Web3 native mechanics

1. Retroactive funding
2. Chains of NFTs
3. Fragmented ownership of NFTs
4. Onchain attestation and reputation

### Onchain reputation

It'll emerge naturally

## Why to put design on chain?

### Knowledge sharing

Like traditional patents, but much more flexible.

### Global collaboration and access to best talents

People all over the world could contribute and benefit from the success of Space Missions.

### Interoperability

With onchain design it makes it easier to automate certain operations, like dealing with complience and proving your design is compliant onchain using ZK proofs.

That would reduce bureaucracy, resulting in lover mission cost, accelerating space exploration.

### Medium of exchange for space companies

Having d detailed ledger of designs, subsystems, makes it easier to access and after all exchange information about designs accross all the supply chain fast.

### Optimisation of certain operations

As of time of writing it costs less than a cent to do a transaction on Ethereum L2 chains, making financial transactions in a sence very efficient, and it's just the begginig. 

Using those mechanics for space missions would decrease the cost.

## Application Examples

### One's Mans Trash Another's Treasure

There are XXX tracked by YYY space debris on the orbit.

The debris are often old satellites, parts of rockets, etc. They are still valuable for the materials, that could be used to build a base on the Moon, or new spacecrafts on the orbit!

It takes ~9.3 km/s delta V to put "debris into the orbit, while only YYY km/s to get to the Moon.

With Astroscale achivement we entered the era when we can send probes close enough to starting thinking of redirecting missions!

We made it almost ZZZ% in delta v to the Moon, why to deorbit? 

The main complexity is that all the debris has unique parameters, shape, mass, orbit, etc.

Every single one of them is unique, and it's not possible to make a general purpose deorbiting system.

Sounds like a perfect job crowdsource! Many people could collaborate, including AI, and having onchain information about contribution could help to distribute the reward. 

At some point in time thouse people could be payed by commercial Lunar Mining companies for the resources that they've got :D

The system becomes even more interesting with respect to [SpaceDAO.AI](https://spacedao.ai/) to put ledger of space debris onchain.

### PS

Thank you a rando met during Popup Archipelago in Chaing Mai 2025 for comming with the name NFT-Blueprints!
