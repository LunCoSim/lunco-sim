# NFT Blueprints

Putting Space Mission design on chain.

## Abstract

Putting design on chain - ankoring it improves the efficiency of funds distribution. It's a form of specialised DeSci's IP-NFTs for Space Mission and Subsystems design.

The final goal is to summon a protocol for onchain design of Space Missions and Subsystems. 

That should results in a new market emergence, brbridging web3 into space industry and onboarding space engineers into web3.

## Implications

### Putting royalties on chain

NFT-blueprints can be used to put royalties on chain, taking the best from both worlds.

NFT could represent a patent or something similar, while binding legally ownership (actually a more complecx structures could emerage), and making royalties onchain.

### Web3 native mechanics

1. Retroactive funding
2. Chains of NFTs
3. Fragmented ownership of NFTs
4. Onchain attestation and reputation

## Why to put design on chain?

### Knowledge sharing

Like traditional patents, but much more flexible.

### Global collaboration and access to best talents

## Application Examples

### One's Mans Trash Another's Treasure

There are XXX tracked by YYY space debris on the orbit.

The debris are often old satellites, parts of rockets, etc. They are still valuable for the materials, that could be used to build a base on the Moon, or new spacecrafts on the orbit!

It takes ~9.3 km/s delta V to put "debris into the orbit, while only YYY km/s to get to the Moon.

With Astroscale achivement we entered the era when we can send probes close enough to starting thinking of redirecting missions!

We made it almost ZZZ% in delta v to the Moon, why to deorbit? 

The main complexity is that all the debris has unique parameters, shape, mass, orbit, etc.

Every single one of them is unique, and it's not possible to make a general purpose deorbiting system.

Sounds like a perfect job crowdsource! Many people could collaborate, including AI, and having onchain information about contribution could help to distribute the reward. 

At some point in time thouse people could be payed by commercial Lunar Mining companies for the resources that they've got :D

The system becomes even more interesting with respect to [SpaceDAO.AI](https://spacedao.ai/) to put ledger of space debris onchain.
