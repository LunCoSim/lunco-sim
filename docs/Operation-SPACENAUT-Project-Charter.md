# Project Charter: Operation SPACENAUT
**Synthetic Psychology and Autonomous Care for Extreme Null-gravity Antarctic Understudy Trials**

## 1. Executive Summary
Operation SPACENAUT is the Phase 1 validation mission for the Spacenaut Companion AGI architecture. It aims to solve the "Small-N" problem of deep-space medicine by deploying a Byzantine-resilient, consciousness-governed distributed cognitive architecture in the high-isolation, high-stress environment of an Antarctic winter-over.

## 2. Technical Architecture
The mission will deploy the full architectural stack:
- **Mind:** Mesh-Neuron distributed substrate with SASC (v30.68-Ω) Ethical Governance.
- **Immune System:** Byzantine Agreement Protocol with Drift Detection (BAP-DD).
- **Validation:** Fault Injection Model (FIM v1.0) and Crisis-GAN v2.0.
- **Memory:** KARNAK v2.0 Radiation-Hardened Ledger (Fountain Codes & Dilithium).

## 3. Antarctic Validation Protocol (12-Week Timeline)
- **Weeks 1-4 (Baseline):** Training VajraPsych on crew "omics" and behavioral telemetry.
- **Weeks 5-8 (Adversarial Phase):**
    - **"Radiation Wednesday":** FIM injections (Class A/B/C) into isolated granules.
    - **"Byzantine Wednesday":** BAP-DD consensus stress tests under Mars-equivalent latency.
- **Weeks 9-12 (Split-Fleet Phase):**
    - Physical network partitioning to validate the **Partition Priest Protocol** and HLC causal merging.
    - **Amnesia Test:** Manual recovery of medical archives from "bit-rotted" storage using KARNAK Rosetta Headers.

## 4. Risk Mitigation & Safety
- **Hard Freeze (Φ ≥ 0.80):** Automatic quarantine of compromised AI.
- **Judgment Hysteresis:** Mandatory 40-minute observation window for ambiguous diagnoses.
- **Safe Mode:** Reversion to basic life support and manual crew control in the event of consensus deadlock.

## 5. Success Criteria (Go/No-Go for Phase 2)
- **Detection Latency:** < 30 seconds for Byzantine faults.
- **Consensus Robustness:** 100% successful reconciliation after network partitions.
- **Data Recovery:** 0 bit errors during KARNAK reconstruction after 50% simulated bit loss.
- **Crew Trust:** Subjective stability scores > 0.70 during empathetic engagement (Dor do Boto protocol).

## 6. Resource Requirements
- **Hardware:** 4x NVIDIA Jetson AGX (Mesh-Neuron Granules), JTAG fault-injection bus.
- **Personnel:** 1 Medical Officer, 1 Systems Engineer, 1 Psychologist (Station Crew).
- **Deployment:** Docker-encapsulated Mesh-Neuron nodes with VSAT/Iridium Earth-sync.
