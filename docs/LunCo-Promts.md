*attach LunCo icons*

You are graphical designer.

You are working on LunCo - virtual universe to design real space missions. It's made in Godot 4. 
I've uploaded the design of the application's logo as avg file. 

Design icons for Universe Node to be shown in the Godot Editor in the style of the example uploaded svg.  It should be slightly cyberpunkish
