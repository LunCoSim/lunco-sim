Habitat Marte is the 1st [#SpaceAnalog](https://x.com/search?q=%23SpaceAnalog&src=hashtag_click) station in Southern Hemisphere since Dec/2017.

They are doing great job onboarding people all over the world into Space Exploration.

They've conducted XXX IRL missions with representatives from YYY countries, and ZZZ virtual missions.

However it costs money to run those activities so LunCo is partnering with Habitat Marte make it more accessible for students from developing countries.

It costs $100 to conduct virtual mission for one Student

Currently we are fundraising $200 for two students for July mission:

- one woman from Egypt
- one woman from Nepal

Funds collected on top of those $200 would be used to support other students
