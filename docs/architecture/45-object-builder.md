# 45 — Object Builder

Design analysis for an in-app tool that builds and edits simulation objects: a canvas
for wiring connections, an editor for the Rhai behaviour attached to a prim, a USD prim
tree with derived parameter editors, and assembly-from-components — reconfiguring a
rover's bogie, or building a new rover or robotic arm out of parts.

This is analysis, not a plan of record. It exists to answer one question before any
code is written: **what actually has to be built, versus what already exists and merely
has to be connected?**

The answer is that roughly four-fifths of the substrate is already there, one of the
hard problems has no solution at all today, and there is a performance cliff sitting
directly in the path of the most-requested feature.

---

## 1. What already exists

Each of these is load-bearing for the tool and needs no new foundation.

**A generic node-graph canvas.** `crates/lunco-canvas` is already substrate, not a
Modelica editor. `Node { kind: SmolStr, data: Box<dyn Any>, ports }` (`scene.rs:295`)
with a `VisualRegistry` that rebuilds visuals from `(kind, data)` on load. The Modelica
diagram is one *projector* on top of it (`kind = "modelica.icon"` / `"modelica.connection"`).
The crate doc names future non-Modelica hosts explicitly. A USD connection canvas is a
second projector, not a second canvas.

**Typed, invertible USD edit ops.** `UsdOp` (`crates/lunco-usd/src/document.rs:209`) has
eleven variants — `AddPrim` (with a `reference` arc), `RemovePrim`, `MovePrim`,
`SetAttribute`, `SetTranslate`, `SetRotate`, `SetRelationship`, `SetConnection`,
`SetTimeSample`, `RemoveTimeSample`, `ReplaceSource`. Every one carries an
`edit_target: LayerId` and every one returns its inverse when applied.

**A two-layer document.** `base ⊕ runtime` (`document.rs:424`). The base is the authored
`.usda`; the runtime layer is an overlay that never touches the base file. Composition is
memoized by generation.

**Incremental reprojection into the live world.** `sync_twin_overlays`
(`crates/lunco-usd/src/twin_projection.rs:290`) replays the document's typed op log onto
the live composed stage; openusd's change sink drains into ECS spawn/despawn/transform
reconciliation. Only four ops force a full rebuild (below).

**A canonical journal.** `crates/lunco-twin-journal` stores `op + inverse` per entry in a
causal DAG with `(lamport, author)` tie-break, persists to disk, replays deterministically,
and merges across peers. USD ops already journal automatically — any `DocumentHost` with a
`JournalOpRecorder` attached records on `apply`. **Nothing needs to be done to make Object
Builder edits journal.** They will journal because they are `UsdOp`s.

**A derivation-based Inspector.** `crates/lunco-sandbox-edit/src/ui/inspector.rs` already
discovers what is editable from which components an entity carries, and writes back through
the correct layer per domain — Modelica params via `ModelicaOp` + recompile, USD attrs into
the runtime layer, joint setpoints via port writes.

**Real USD variant sets.** Not aspirational: `skid_rover.usda:47-51` declares
`variantSets = "drivetrain"` with `raycast` / `physical` selections that swap the entire
drivetrain component. `ackermann_rover.usda` does the same. The composition engine resolves
them; Rust reads the flattened result.

---

## 2. The edit-and-reboot loop already works — for twin-backed scenes

This was worth checking, because it looked like the weak point and is not.

`RestartScene` (`crates/lunco-usd-sim/src/cosim.rs:1186`) calls `asset_server.reload(ap)`
with the comment *"Force a fresh disk read so on-disk edits actually apply."* Read alone,
that says in-memory edits are lost on reboot.

They are not, because it deliberately reuses the stage **handle**, preserving the
`twin://` scheme (`cosim.rs:1198-1207`). A `twin://` path does not resolve to the raw file —
it resolves through `TwinRoots`, which serves the *composed* `base ⊕ runtime` bytes that
`drain_pending_twin_docs` published (`twin_projection.rs:255`) and `sync_twin_overlays`
keeps current. The runtime layer additionally persists to `<twin-root>/.lunco/runtime/…`
(`runtime_persistence.rs:39`), so edits survive not just reboot but process exit.

So: **edit → journal → reboot → edits still there** is a property the system has today, and
it holds precisely for scenes opened as documents under a Twin. It does *not* hold for a
scene loaded as a plain file path, which reloads raw base bytes and drops the runtime layer.

The design consequence is a rule, not a feature: **the Object Builder must only ever operate
on doc-backed twin scenes.** If it can open a raw file, it silently eats the user's work on
the first reboot. Enforce it at open time rather than discovering it in a bug report.

(Minor inconsistency to resolve while there: `journal_persistence.rs:40` writes
`history/journal.json`, while `runtime_persistence.rs:38` describes it as `.lunco/journal/`.
The comment is wrong or the path is; they should agree.)

## 3. The real gaps

### 3.1 There is no spatial component interface — this is the hard one

The user's ask is "build from components… change rover bogie configuration… build new
rovers/robotic hands." Today that is not a UI problem. It is a data-model problem.

A component is attached by hand-authoring **two independent sets of coordinates that
nothing checks against each other**:

1. the referencing prim's own `xformOp:translate` — where the part sits, and
2. a separate joint prim's `physics:localPos0` / `localPos1` — where the constraint anchors.

`imu.usda:10-13` states this outright. `rocker_bogie.usda:649-763` pays the price: ten
explicit revolute joints, each with hand-written anchor numbers. Moving a wheel means
editing its transform and then, in a different part of the file, the joint's anchor, and
getting both right. Nothing validates them. Nothing derives one from the other.

Grep confirms there is no `lunco:mount`, no attachment frame, no socket, nothing spatial:

```
rg 'lunco:mount|mount_frame|attach_frame|socket'   → 0 hits in assets, 0 relevant in rust
```

You cannot build a "snap a wheel onto a bogie" tool on top of that, because there is
nothing on either part that says *where a wheel goes* or *what kind of joint belongs there*.
Every assembly UI would have to invent the numbers, which is exactly what the human is
doing now.

**Proposal — declare mounts in USD.** A host advertises sockets; a component advertises
the frame by which it attaches.

```usda
def Xform "Mounts"
{
    def Xform "wheel_fl" (kind = "mount")
    {
        uniform token  lunco:mount:socket = "wheel"      # what may attach
        uniform token  lunco:mount:joint  = "revolute"   # the constraint it implies
        vector3f       lunco:mount:axis   = (1, 0, 0)
        double3 xformOp:translate = (1.2, -0.3, 0.9)     # the frame itself
        uniform token[] xformOpOrder = ["xformOp:translate"]
    }
}
```

and on the component's `defaultPrim`:

```usda
uniform token lunco:mount:plug = "wheel"   # what socket this fits
rel lunco:mount:frame = </Wheel/Mounts/hub>
```

Then a new op — call it `AttachComponent { edit_target, socket_path, asset, prim, name }` —
is a **macro that lowers to existing ops**:

- `AddPrim { reference }` for the part,
- `SetTranslate` / `SetRotate` computed so the plug frame coincides with the socket frame,
- `AddPrim` for the joint, with `localPos0`/`localPos1` and `physics:axis` *derived from the
  two frames* rather than typed by a human.

Its inverse is two `RemovePrim`s, so it journals and undoes like everything else. Bogie
reconfiguration becomes "move the socket"; the joint anchor follows, because it was never an
independent number.

This is the single highest-leverage change in this document, and the only one that requires
inventing schema rather than wiring existing parts.

**Status — the lowering landed; the mount-frame layer is deferred by design.**
`AttachComponent` exists as a command (`crates/lunco-usd/src/commands.rs`) over a pure
op-lowering (`crates/lunco-usd/src/attach.rs`, `attach_component_ops`). It removes the
duplicate-number problem *today*: given a placement, it references the part in, places it, and
authors the joint with `localPos0 = placement`, `localPos1 = origin` — the exact convention
every joint in `rocker_bogie.usda` already follows (`localPos1 = (0,0,0)` throughout). The
anchor is derived, never retyped. It is unit-tested at the op level (five tests): anchor
derivation, body-relating, axis-per-joint-kind, joint-type mapping, and apply-order safety.

What is **deliberately not** in v1: rotated placement and socket/plug frame matching. Those
compute a *placement* from two `lunco:mount:*` frames and then call this same lowering — but a
wrong frame conversion is a physics bug visible only with the renderer running, so the frame
math is held until it can be validated in-app rather than shipped blind. The schema above is
the spec for that layer; the lowering beneath it is done and tested.

### 3.2 Four missing UsdOps — DONE

All four now exist on `UsdOp` (`crates/lunco-usd/src/document.rs`), each with a typed or
snapshot inverse, so all four journal and undo like every other op:

- **`SetVariantSelection { path, variant_set, variant }`** — read-modify-writes the
  `variantSelection` map so a sibling set's selection survives. "Change the rover bogie
  configuration" is now one op. Recomposes a subtree → projector rebuilds.
- **`SetApiSchemas { path, schemas }`** — explicit-list-op author of `apiSchemas`, so a
  runtime-built prim can be made a rigid body / collider. Projector **rebuilds** (see §3.3).
- **`SetPayload { path, asset_paths }`** — explicit-list-op author of `payload`. Recomposes
  a subtree → projector rebuilds.
- **`SetActive { path, active }`** — non-destructive "disable this part"; snapshot inverse
  (NOT `!active`, which would mis-undo a no-op deactivation). Projector **rebuilds** (§3.3).

### 3.3 The performance cliff — RESOLVED

`op_needs_rebuild` (`twin_projection.rs`) used to force a full scene recompose for
`SetRelationship`. A physics joint authors `rel physics:body0` and `rel physics:body1` — two
`SetRelationship`s — so **every component attach rebuilt the whole world**, twice per joint.

Both `SetRelationship` and `SetConnection` now have incremental live-stage authors
(`CanonicalStage::author_relationship` / `author_connection`) and were removed from the
rebuild set. `SetRelationship` refreshes only the owning prim's subtree (or, for
`material:binding`, fans out to scene visuals since a binding reaches meshes anywhere).

**A second, silent bug surfaced while fixing this:** `SetConnection` was *classified* as
incremental but had **no arm** in `apply_incremental_op_to_stage` — it fell through `_ => {}`.
So every cosim wire authored at runtime reached the document and never the live stage: a
dropped edit that only appeared after the next unrelated full rebuild. Now authored and
refreshed. This is exactly the wire-drawing path the connection canvas (§4) depends on.

Four ops still rebuild, correctly: `SetVariantSelection` and `SetPayload` (value resolution
re-composes the affected subtree wholesale, which the incremental sink can't express), and —
found during verification — `SetApiSchemas` and `SetActive`. The incremental subtree refresh
(`reinstantiate_entity`) only re-derives an entity's *visual*; it does not re-run physics
extraction or despawn the entity. So an apiSchema change wouldn't actually make a prim a rigid
body at runtime, and `SetActive(false)` wouldn't remove its entity — the visual-only refresh is
the wrong tool. A rebuild re-derives the physics component set and the active-prim set correctly.
This does **not** touch the attach hot-path: `AttachComponent` emits neither op, so building a
vehicle from parts stays rebuild-free (its `AddPrim`/`SetTranslate`/`SetRelationship`/
`SetAttribute` ops all replay incrementally).

Historical note — the two ways out that were weighed:

- Give `SetRelationship` an incremental live-stage author (it is absent, not impossible —
  the stage API has `author_reference`, so relationship authoring is the same shape), or
- Batch a macro op into one rebuild by suppressing reprojection until the macro completes,
  which is cheaper to implement and strictly worse for interactivity.

The first is correct. The second is a fallback.

### 3.4 Undo is built and unwired

`UndoManager` (`lunco-twin-journal/src/lib.rs:1473`) has per-author stacks, `UndoScope::{Document, Twin}`,
`take_undo`/`take_redo`. Grep finds it instantiated **only in its own crate's tests**. Meanwhile
`DocumentHost` keeps a separate live inverse-op stack that *is* wired.

Two undo systems, unreconciled — this is gap #3 in `docs/architecture/18-unified-journal-and-history.md`.
No snapshots are needed to close it: every journal entry already stores its inverse. The work is
deciding which stack is authoritative and honouring author-scope so undo in a networked session
doesn't revert a peer's edit.

An object builder without undo is a toy. This must land.

### 3.5 Parameters are an untyped string

`lunco:params = "rest_altitude=1.5, kv=1.2"` is split on `,`, then `=`, then
`parse::<f64>()` — **non-numeric values are silently dropped** (`lunco-usd-bevy/src/lib.rs:910-925`).
It feeds `param(me, key, default)` in Rhai and nothing else. It is not a USD-attr or
Modelica-param override channel.

Typed per-component config already exists the right way, as real USD attributes
(`wheel.usda:42-51`: `double lunco:springStiffness`, `lunco:motorPower`, …). The gap is that
nothing declares their bounds, units, or documentation, so an editor cannot derive a control.

USD gives this for free via per-attribute `customData`:

```usda
double lunco:springStiffness = 1200 (
    customData = { double min = 0; double max = 5000; string unit = "N/m" }
)
```

The Inspector already iterates discovered parameters; extending it to read `customData` for
range and unit turns every existing component into an editable one with no per-type UI code.
That preserves the project's standing rule that the Inspector *derives* and never hardcodes.

### 3.6 No prim tree, no script editor, no script diagnostics UI

- The Twin Browser shows **files, not prims** (`ListTwinProvider` returns `twin.files()`).
  There is no USD prim tree anywhere in the UI.
- There is a Modelica code editor with a hand-rolled syntax layouter
  (`code_editor.rs:673`) and **no editor for `.rhai` or `.usda`** — only a plain-TextEdit
  REPL panel.
- Script diagnostics carry line and column (`ScriptStatus` → `{severity, message, line, col}`)
  and **nothing consumes them**. Modelica has a diagnostics panel with click-to-source; scripting
  has no analogue. The data exists; the consumer doesn't.
- Live-edited scenarios **cannot be saved back to their USD prim** — an acknowledged TODO at
  `lunco-scripting/src/commands.rs:198`. For "create/edit rhai models" this is a blocker, not a polish item.

Also worth stating plainly, because it will otherwise arrive as a bug report: a scenario's
per-entity `this` state is wiped on hot-reload and on scene restart, by design
(`scenario.rs:320`, `world_bridge.rs:924-957`). Reboot means behaviour restarts from scratch.

---

## 4. Shape of the tool

Nothing in `lunco-workbench` needs to change. A perspective is a layout preset; panels register
into slots; per-perspective dock isolation and per-Twin layout persistence are free.

```
┌ Object Builder ────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Prim Tree    │  Canvas (connections)  /  Viewport   │ Inspector │
│  (new)       │       (new projector)                │ (extend)  │
│ Palette      │                                      │ Params    │
│  (exists)    ├──────────────────────────────────────┤ (extend)  │
│              │ Script editor + diagnostics (new)    │           │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Connection canvas** = a second `lunco-canvas` projector. Nodes are prims carrying
`inputs:*` / `outputs:*` (`kind = "usd.prim"`); edges are `connectionPaths`
(`kind = "usd.connection"`). Wire-drag emits `UsdOp::SetConnection`; that is the entire
write path, and it journals for free.

Node layout needs somewhere to live. Modelica stores placement in `.mo` annotations. The USD
equivalent is an authored attribute — `float2 lunco:canvas:pos` on the prim — which journals
like any other edit. **Debounce it.** A drag advances the document generation every frame, and
`sync_twin_overlays` already learned this lesson the expensive way (`twin_projection.rs:305-310`,
~212µs/frame of wasted recomposition before it was fixed).

---

## 5. Sequencing

Ordered by what unblocks what, not by visibility.

**Phase 0 — make the loop safe.** Refuse to open non-doc-backed scenes in the builder. Wire
`UndoManager`. Add `SetVariantSelection`. Give `SetRelationship` an incremental author so the
attach path doesn't rebuild the world. None of this is visible; all of it is load-bearing.

**Phase 1 — see and tune.** USD prim tree panel. Inspector reads `customData` for ranges and
units. This alone delivers "modify parameters" and most of "edit USD models".

**Phase 2 — wire.** Connection canvas as a second projector. Small, because the substrate and
the op both exist.

**Phase 3 — assemble.** `lunco:mount:*` schema, `AttachComponent` macro op, palette drag-to-socket.
This is what makes "build a new rover or a robotic arm" a real sentence. Retrofit `wheel.usda`
and `rocker_bogie.usda` as the proving ground: the bogie should lose its hand-written joint anchors.

**Phase 4 — behaviour.** Rhai editor with the Modelica layouter pattern, diagnostics gutter fed
by the line/col that `ScriptStatus` already returns, and save-back-to-prim
(`commands.rs:198`) closed.

Phase 3 is the interesting one and the only one that invents anything. Phases 0–2 are mostly
connecting parts that were built for this and never joined up.

---

## 6. What could go wrong

- **Attach = rebuild.** §3.3. Decide before building the canvas.
- **Canvas layout churn.** Node positions are journaled document edits. Debounce or the journal
  fills with drag frames.
- **Op-ring overflow.** More edits than ring capacity between syncs returns `None` from
  `ops_since` and forces a rebuild. A fast interactive tool can hit this; the fallback is correct
  but slow.
- **Raw-file scenes.** §2. A silent data-loss path if the builder is allowed to open one.
- **`this` is not persistent.** §3.6. Reboot restarts behaviour. Surface it in the UI rather
  than letting it read as a bug.
- **No reduced-coordinate articulation.** `PhysicsArticulationRootAPI` is a tag and an authority
  hint, not a solver. Assemblies are pairwise Avian joints plus one soft differential constraint.
  A ten-joint robotic arm built by snapping parts will inherit whatever accuracy and stability
  pairwise joints give — a mount schema makes such an arm *authorable*, it does not make it
  *well-conditioned*. That is a separate problem and should not be discovered during Phase 3.
