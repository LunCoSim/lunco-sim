# Collaborative Missions

LunCoSim is designed for teamwork. In **Network Mode**, you can run missions "With Friends," where each player takes on a specific role.

## 🔗 How to Connect

### Hosting a Session
1.  Open the **Network Menu** (top-right corner).
2.  Click **Host**.
3.  Share your **IP Address** with your teammates.
    *   *Note: You may need to port forward or use a VPN (like Hamachi/Tailscale) if playing over the internet.*

### Joining a Session
1.  Open the **Network Menu**.
2.  Enter the Host's **IP Address**.
3.  Click **Join**.

## 🤝 Roles & Coordination

In a collaborative session, coordination is key. Recommended roles include:

*   **Commander**: Oversees the mission, manages the master timeline.
*   **Pilot**: Controls the Rover or Spacecraft.
*   **Flight Engineer**: Monitors telemetry (OpenMCT), manages power/thermal systems via the Solver Graph.
*   **EVA Specialist**: Controls the Astronaut for surface operations.

> [!NOTE]
> All players share the same physical world. If the Pilot drives the rover into a crater, the Flight Engineer will see the telemetry spike immediately!
