# Supply Chain Modeling

The Supply Chain view allows you to design and monitor resource flows (Oxygen, Hydrogen, Power, etc.) using a node-based interface.

## 📊 The Graph View

Access the graph view to see the internal "nervous system" of your lunar base.

### Controls

| Action | Input |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pan View** | Middle Mouse Button / Arrow Keys |
| **Zoom** | Mouse Wheel / `+` `-` |
| **Select Node** | `Left Click` |
| **View Details** | See **Details Panel** (Top-Right) |
| **Search** | Use the Search Bar (Top-Left) to find nodes by ID or Name. |

## 🏭 Designing Flows

1.  **Sources**: Extract resources (e.g., Regolith).
2.  **Processors**: Convert resources (e.g., Electrolysis: Water -> O2 + H2).
3.  **Sinks**: Store or consume resources (e.g., Fuel Tanks, Life Support).

Connect nodes to establish flow. The **Solver** calculates rates, pressures, and valid interactions in real-time.

> [!TIP]
> Use the **Details Panel** to tweak node parameters like "Efficiency" or "Power Output" on the fly and watch how it affects the entire grid.
