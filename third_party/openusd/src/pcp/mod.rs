//! Prim Cache Population (PCP) — the composition engine.
//!
//! This module implements USD's composition algorithm, which merges opinions
//! from multiple layers into a single composed scene graph. It is the Rust
//! equivalent of [Pixar's PCP module](https://openusd.org/dev/api/pcp_page_front.html).
//!
//! # LIVERPS strength ordering
//!
//! USD composes opinions using seven arc types, ordered by strength
//! (mnemonic "liver-peas"):
//!
//! 1. **L**ocal — direct opinions in the root layer stack (sublayers)
//! 2. **I**nherits — opinions from class prims (`inherits = </Class>`)
//! 3. **V**ariants — opinions from the selected variant (`variants = { string v = "sel" }`)
//! 4. **R**elocates — non-destructive namespace remapping (`relocates = { </Src>: </Tgt> }`)
//! 5. **R**eferences — opinions from referenced layers (`references = @model.usd@</Prim>`)
//! 6. **P**ayloads — like references but deferred (`payload = @heavy.usd@</Prim>`)
//! 7. **S**pecializes — like inherits but weakest (`specializes = </Base>`)
//!
//! Within each arc type, opinions are ordered by layer strength (root layer
//! strongest, deepest sublayer weakest).
//!
//! # Relocates
//!
//! Relocates are non-destructive namespace remapping authored via
//! `relocates = { </Source>: </Target> }` in a layer's metadata. They
//! allow moving prims in the composed namespace without modifying the
//! underlying layers. They are split between the indexer and the cache:
//!
//! - `layerRelocates` are extracted from each layer's pseudoroot at
//!   construction and mapped into the composed namespace through each
//!   layer's namespace mapping.
//! - When composing a prim that is a relocate target, the indexer
//!   (`eval_node_relocations`) finds the pre-relocation source path, composes
//!   it as a sub-index, and grafts the result as a `Relocate` arc node. Each
//!   grafted node carries the source site's full layer stack, so a relocate
//!   source spanning several sublayers keeps every member, not just the
//!   strongest.
//! - Child names are folded per composition node: each node's layer-stack
//!   relocates (chained within the layer stack) rename, remove, or add direct
//!   children, and every relocation source becomes a prohibited name
//!   (`IndexCache::compute_prim_child_names` → `relocates::apply_child_relocates`).
//!
//! # Module structure
//!
//! | Item | C++ equivalent | Description |
//! |------|---------------|-------------|
//! | `layer_graph` | `PcpLayerStack` | The loaded layers and their sublayer DAG, keyed by the graph-minted [`LayerId`] handle (physical layer storage). Owns the composed-stack registry (`layer_stack`). Owned by [`Stage`](crate::usd::Stage), passed to each build by shared reference. Sublayer edges are always derived from `subLayers` metadata, the single source of truth. |
//! | `layer_stack` | `PcpLayerStack` identity | Composed-stack identity ([`LayerStackId`]) and the registry of context-keyed instances (`LayerStackRegistry`): a [`LayerId`] names a physical layer, a [`LayerStackId`] a composed view under a context, so a `${VAR}` sublayer reached through two contexts resolves independently. |
//! | `index_cache` | `PcpCache` | Lazily-built composition cache (`IndexCache`). Main interface for [`Stage`](crate::usd::Stage). Borrows the `layer_graph` per query. |
//! | `instancing` | `Pcp` instancing | Scene-graph instancing (spec 11.3.3): the `PrototypeRegistry` object (owned by `IndexCache`) plus the composition glue (`is_instance`, the `effective_path` redirection that maps an instance proxy's subtree onto the shared `/__Prototype_N` namespace) as a second `IndexCache` impl. |
//! | [`Error`] | `PcpErrorBase` | Composition errors: arc cycles, unresolved layers, missing/invalid `defaultPrim`. |
//! | `prim_index` | `PcpPrimIndex` | Per-prim composition support: the [`PrimIndex`] type with its build entry points (`build_with_cache` / `build_with_cache_in`) and the [`CompositionContext`](prim_index::CompositionContext) that flows parent-to-child. |
//! | `compose_site` | `PcpComposeSite` | Site field composition: the list-op primitives (`compose_references_in`, `collect_payloads_in`, `compose_arc_list_in`) the `prim_indexer` drives to read a node's arc fields across its layer stack, plus the asset-path anchoring and time-codes retiming they fold in. |
//! | `prim_indexer` | `Pcp_PrimIndexer` | Task-queue composition engine (`Indexer`): grows the graph node-by-node by draining a priority task queue. The sole composition path. |
//! | `prim_graph` | `PcpPrimIndex` / `PcpNodeRef` | Arena-backed `PrimIndexGraph` of [`Node`]s with parent/child and origin links, plus the strength-order projection. |
//! | `prim_resolve` | — | Value resolution over a composed [`PrimIndex`]: the per-field strength-ordered opinion walk (spec section 12). |
//! | `mapping` | `PcpMapFunction` | Namespace mapping between composition arcs — each [`Node`] carries `map_to_parent` and `map_to_root`. |
//! | [`VariantFallbackMap`] | `PcpVariantFallbackMap` | Maps variant set names to ordered fallback selections, used when no selection is authored. |
//! | `load_rules` | `UsdStageLoadRules` | Per-path payload-inclusion policy ([`LoadRules`]/[`Rule`]): nearest-ancestor-with-lookahead rule resolution, plus the `IndexCache` glue that turns a rule change into per-build payload-expansion decisions and bounded cache invalidation. |
//! | `relocates` | — | Stateless relocate free functions (effective relocates, transitive chaining, child-name folding). Layer-authored pairs and stack-effective queries are read from `LayerGraph`; all data is passed through parameters. |
//! | `dependencies` | `Pcp_Dependencies` | Reverse `(LayerId, site) → prim-index paths` map (`Dependencies`) driving surgical change fanout. |
//!
//! Layer loading lives in [`sdf::LayerRegistry`](crate::sdf::LayerRegistry); the
//! loaded layers and their sublayer DAG are held in [`layer_graph::LayerGraph`].
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! Each [`PrimIndex`](prim_index::PrimIndex) is an arena-backed, single-rooted tree
//! of [`Node`]s: a synthetic, inert root owns every otherwise-parentless node,
//! so the graph is one tree rather than a forest. Nodes carry two namespace
//! mappings: `map_to_parent` (translates paths to the parent node's namespace)
//! and `map_to_root` (translates directly to the root namespace). These
//! [`MapFunction`]s are the foundation for namespace remapping across
//! composition arcs (including relocates). After construction, a separate
//! projection orders the nodes strongest-to-weakest — a pre-order DFS of
//! strength-ordered children followed by the globally-weak specializes band —
//! so value resolution is a linear scan.
//!
//! Composition is driven by a [`CompositionContext`](prim_index::CompositionContext)
//! that flows from parent prims to children. The context carries:
//!
//! - Variant selections from all ancestors, so descendant prims resolve
//!   variant sets without recomputing ancestor composition.
//! - Arc mappings from ancestors, recording how composed paths map to
//!   paths in other layers. Used for descendant namespace remapping and
//!   implied inherit propagation.
//!
//! # Variant fallbacks
//!
//! A [`VariantFallbackMap`] can be provided when opening a stage via
//! [`StageBuilder::variant_fallbacks`](crate::usd::StageBuilder::variant_fallbacks).
//! When a prim has a variant set but no authored selection, the engine tries
//! each fallback in order. The first fallback matching an existing variant in
//! the set is used; if none match, the set stays unselected. Authored
//! selections always take priority over fallbacks.
//!
//! The [`IndexCache`](index_cache::IndexCache) stores both the [`PrimIndex`](prim_index::PrimIndex)
//! and the [`CompositionContext`](prim_index::CompositionContext) for each composed
//! prim. During depth-first traversal, parents are always composed before
//! children, so the context chain is always populated. Each per-prim build
//! takes only shared references, making it suitable for future parallel
//! execution.
//!
//! Recoverable composition errors ([`Error`]) are retained by the cache and
//! exposed through [`Stage::composition_errors`](crate::usd::Stage::composition_errors).
//! Operational failures are returned to the caller.
//!
//! # Cache invalidation
//!
//! When a layer is authored, only the prim indices observably affected by
//! the write are dropped from the cache. The pipeline mirrors C++
//! `PcpChanges`:
//!
//! 1. The authoring callsite returns an [`sdf::ChangeList`](crate::sdf::ChangeList)
//!    describing what it just did (the path, flag bits for spec adds/removes,
//!    field names in `info_changed`).
//! 2. [`Changes::did_change`] reads the change list and classifies each
//!    entry into one of three tiers:
//!    - Significant — graph topology may be wrong. Drop the index and every
//!      namespace descendant. Triggered by composition-arc fields
//!      (`references`, `payload`, `inheritPaths`, `specializes`,
//!      `variantSetNames`, `variantSelection`, `instanceable`, `specifier`,
//!      `active`) and by non-inert prim adds/removes.
//!    - Prim — local rebuild only, descendants survive. Currently collapsed
//!      into significant; the field exists for a future finer-grained split.
//!    - Spec — graph topology is fine, only a spec stack changed. An inert spec
//!      add/remove rescans `has_specs` in place over the memoized per-node spec
//!      stack and keeps the index.
//!
//!    Layer-stack-tier flags (`subLayers`, sublayer offsets,
//!    `timeCodesPerSecond`, `expressionVariables`, `layerRelocates`,
//!    `defaultPrim`) recompose the affected layer stacks and drop only the
//!    indices that read them (`IndexCache::invalidate_layers`), not the whole
//!    cache.
//!
//! 3. [`Changes::apply`] surgically removes the affected entries from the
//!    cache. Indices rebuild lazily on next access.
//!
//! A reverse `(LayerId, site_path) → prim_index_paths` map (the
//! `Dependencies` table internal to the cache) makes step 2 cheap: every
//! [`PrimIndex`](prim_index::PrimIndex) registers its observed sites when it
//! finishes building, and the classifier looks up dependents — including
//! ancestors of the changed site, since an arc at `/Foo` makes `/Foo/Bar`'s
//! composition transitively dependent on `/Foo`.
//!
//! Property-tier authoring (attribute values, time samples) never invalidates
//! the prim graph: those queries read live layer data on every call. A
//! `targetPaths`/`connectionPaths` edit likewise leaves the graph intact,
//! clearing only the per-property resolved-target memo (keyed by path and
//! target kind) so resolved targets recompute on next read.
//!
//! Layer muting ([`Stage::mute_layer`](crate::usd::Stage::mute_layer) /
//! [`unmute_layer`](crate::usd::Stage::unmute_layer)) recomposes incrementally
//! rather than clearing the cache: the toggle drops only the indices whose
//! composition reads a layer stack containing the (un)muted layer.
//! `LayerGraph::mute_fanout` derives that layer set — the toggled layer, every
//! layer whose subtree contains it, and the root layer when the stage root
//! stack is touched — and `IndexCache`'s layer-muting drop evicts the indices a
//! node (or a recorded muted reference/payload target) ties to it.
//!
//! # Relationship and connection targets
//!
//! A relationship/connection target translates through the contributing node's
//! `map_to_root` ([`MapFunction`]) — the bidirectional invertibility check
//! ([`translate_to_target`](mapping::MapFunction::translate_to_target),
//! C++ `PcpMapFunction::_Map` / `PcpTranslatePathFromNodeToRoot`) and the
//! relocates folded into each arc map (C++ `_CreateMapExpressionForArc` /
//! `GetExpressionForRelocatesAtPath`), including nested relocate chains
//! (`LayerGraph::combined_relocates`) and the *block* a relocate to an
//! out-of-scope prim leaves in the composed map. There is no separate
//! relocate-chaining or escaped-source pass for resolved targets; the
//! deleted-path walk still chains through the prim's effective relocates because
//! it has no per-node origin.
//!
//! A relationship/connection authored in a class that targets a *different*
//! instance of that class is dropped with the "is authored in a class but refers
//! to an instance of that class" message (C++ `PcpErrorInvalidInstanceTargetPath`);
//! the *self* instance keeps the generic out-of-scope message, and a self target
//! reachable through the class's own relocates is kept at its pre-relocation path
//! (the invertibility check yields all three outcomes). The cross-prim "target
//! inherits the class" check (C++ `_TargetInClassAndTargetsInstance`) is
//! `IndexCache::compute_instance_targets`; the per-node target walk in
//! `resolve_path_list_op_validated` drops each invalid contribution from its own
//! node only, so a valid stronger opinion for the same path survives.
//!
//! # Permissions (`permission = private`)
//!
//! `permission` is `sdf`-level metadata only ([`sdf::Permission`]); composition
//! and value resolution never read it. C++'s own arc-, prim-, and
//! target-permission enforcement (`_AddArc`'s privacy check, `_EnforcePermissions`,
//! `_TargetIsPermitted`) is compiled out for `Usd`-mode `PcpCache`s — the mode
//! `UsdStage`, and therefore this crate, always uses — so a real stage never
//! denies an arc or filters a target on `permission`. This is a deliberate
//! parity choice, not a gap: editing `permission` is an ordinary metadata change
//! with no composition effect.
//!
//! # Ordered prim children
//!
//! Child names fold weakest-to-strongest with `primOrder` reapplied per layer
//! (mirroring C++ `PcpComposeSiteChildNames`). Relocates apply per node during
//! that fold (`IndexCache::compute_prim_child_names` → `relocates::apply_child_relocates`,
//! the port of C++ `_ComposePrimChildNamesAtNode`): at each node its layer
//! stack's relocates rename, remove, or add direct children — a renamed child
//! keeps the source's position — and every relocation source becomes a prohibited
//! name removed from the final order.
//!
//! # Structural specializes
//!
//! Specializes global weakness (spec 10.4.1) is realized by copying specializes
//! nodes under the local root (C++ `_PropagateNodeToRoot`, the indexer's
//! `propagate_node_to_root`): specialize is the weakest arc, so
//! `finalize_strength_order`'s plain DFS already places the globally-weak band
//! last and orders it with the C++ `PcpCompareSiblingNodeStrength` comparison.
//!
//! # Remaining work
//!
//! - Cross-prim parallelism: `IndexCache::ensure_index` composes prims serially.
//!   Each build is a pure function of `&LayerGraph`, the parent context, and the
//!   cached indices (`TODO(rayon)`), but the shared `indices` map that
//!   inherit/specialize targets read mid-build first needs a concurrent map or a
//!   targets-first build order. [`PrimIndex`] is already `Send + Sync`.
//! - Resolving `asset` values sourced from time samples or value clips:
//!   `IndexCache::value_at` evaluates expressions and anchors only
//!   default-sourced asset paths (filling their `evaluated_path` /
//!   `resolved_path`); a time-sample or clip value is returned unresolved
//!   because the resolvers do not surface the layer/node of the contributing
//!   sample.
//! - Surfacing asset-path expression failures during value resolution: a
//!   malformed or non-string expression in an `asset` value is dropped silently
//!   (`IndexCache::resolve_asset_path` returns it unevaluated), unlike a
//!   reference/payload arc, which records [`Error::InvalidExpression`]. Value
//!   resolution needs an error channel to report it.
//! - Sharing composed expression variables: `PrimIndex::composed_expr_vars`
//!   recomputes at value-resolution time what `Indexer::composed_expr_vars`
//!   already composed during indexing. Storing the composed set on the index
//!   (or each node) would remove the duplicate walk and the risk of the two
//!   diverging.
//! - Contextual-stack shared-sublayer context: building a contextual stack's
//!   members (`LayerGraph::build_stack_members` → `compose_edges`) gates its walk
//!   on a per-`LayerId` `visited` set, so a sublayer reached through two different
//!   sublayer ancestries within one contextual stack keeps the first ancestry's
//!   expression-variable context. Per-context fidelity holds *across* arcs — each
//!   reference/payload target, and the session-seeded root stack, gets its own
//!   instance — but not for a sublayer diamond *within* a single contextual stack;
//!   a per-`(layer, context)` edge walk would close it.
//! - Releasing a muted layer's memory: `LayerGraph` keeps a muted layer's node
//!   interned so unmute is a rebuild; C++ drops its references. The node and its
//!   backing data are retained for the life of the graph.
//! - Muted sublayer diagnostics: the loader (`LayerRegistry::open_stack`) reports
//!   every missing/unreadable sublayer raw, unaware of muting; the stage reports
//!   only those a muted-aware check finds contributing
//!   (`LayerGraph::sublayer_error_contributes` over `effective_layers`, the members
//!   of every composed stack) and applies it at report time
//!   (`Stage::composition_errors`). The raw diagnostics are never discarded, and the
//!   effective set is a pure function of the muted set and the composed stacks — not
//!   of which prim indices are cached — so a diagnostic's visibility is
//!   deterministic: muting a branch suppresses it and unmuting restores it, for both
//!   the root layer stack and reference/payload target stacks, and it never flickers
//!   as the cache warms.
//!   Remaining — precise target-diagnostic liveness: a reference/payload target
//!   whose only arc becomes muted (the arc's authoring opinion is muted, but the
//!   target root itself is not) stays interned with a non-empty stack, so its own
//!   missing-sublayer diagnostic keeps reporting even though no unmuted arc reaches
//!   it — a conservative over-report. Resolving it precisely means attaching
//!   collection diagnostics to composition sites / stack instances so their
//!   visibility tracks index lifetime and recomposition, rather than deriving it
//!   from the composed-stack set.
//! - Masked cold prototype queries: a query on a `/__Prototype_N` path under a
//!   non-default population mask resolves to empty until an instance sharing
//!   that prototype has been composed (which registers the prototype). The
//!   registry is populated lazily as instances compose, and `Stage::mask_includes`
//!   cannot map a synthetic prototype path back to an instance to compose before
//!   the registry knows it, so a query that addresses the prototype namespace
//!   before any instance is touched reads the default. Reaching the prototype
//!   through an instance (`Prim::prototype`, or any instance-proxy query) first
//!   registers it, after which masked prototype-content queries (including those
//!   behind a lazily-loaded payload) resolve correctly.
//! - Runtime session-selected root sublayers: a session `expressionVariables`
//!   edit, or a mute that exposes the root layer's own variable, can newly select
//!   a root `${VAR}` sublayer the initial session variables never opened. Runtime
//!   session-variable changes resolve root sublayers only against already-interned
//!   layers (`Stage::apply_mute`), so a newly-selected layer is not loaded — the
//!   open-time builder path (`StageBuilder::session_expression_variables`) loads
//!   the initial selection, and a mute that *removes* a variable drops the sublayer
//!   it selected. Loading a newly-selected one at runtime needs an on-demand
//!   sublayer open through the graph.
//!
