//! Layer DAG: the loaded layers and their sublayer structure.
//!
//! [`LayerGraph`] owns every [`sdf::Layer`] a stage depends on and the sublayer
//! edges between them, keyed by the stable [`LayerId`]. It is the Rust
//! analog of C++ `PcpLayerStack` for the layer-ownership half of composition;
//! the composition index itself lives in [`IndexCache`](super::index_cache::IndexCache).
//!
//! Holding layers here (rather than inside the cache) lets a [`Stage`] borrow
//! the layer data and the composition index independently. Composition reads
//! the graph through a shared `&LayerGraph` parameter, so every per-prim build
//! stays a pure function of `(graph, context, cached indices)`.
//!
//! A composed sublayer stack (the depth-first pre-order walk of a root's sublayer
//! edges, with offsets composed) is interned in the
//! [`LayerStackRegistry`](super::layer_stack::LayerStackRegistry) of the
//! [`layer_stack`](super::layer_stack) module and addressed by a [`LayerStackId`];
//! only composition roots get an instance, so a sublayer-only layer participates
//! through its root's members rather than its own stack. The edges are always
//! derived from each layer's `subLayers` metadata by
//! [`recompute_sublayers`](LayerGraph::recompute_sublayers): both an ordinary
//! `subLayers` authoring edit and the public
//! [`Stage::insert_layer`](crate::usd::Stage::insert_layer) /
//! [`remove_layer`](crate::usd::Stage::remove_layer) route through it, so
