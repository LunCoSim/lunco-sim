//! Three-tier change-processing pipeline for the composition cache.
//!
//! Mirrors C++ `PcpChanges`: a pure-analysis diff phase ([`Changes::did_change`])
//! builds invalidation path-sets keyed by tier; the apply phase
//! ([`Changes::apply`]) surgically blows the affected entries from the
//! cache.
//!
//! Tiers (matching C++ `_didChange{Significantly,Prims,Specs}`):
//!
//! - Significant: graph topology may be wrong — drop the index AND every
//!   namespace descendant.
//! - Prim: this index's graph is wrong but descendants survive — drop only
//!   this index. Currently dormant: the spec tier subsumes the one case C++
//!   populates it for (see [`CacheChanges::did_change_prims`]).
//! - Spec: the graph is fine; only whether a site contributes an opinion
//!   changed. An inert spec add or remove authors no arc and no significant
//!   field, so [`IndexCache::rescan_specs`](super::IndexCache::rescan_specs)
//!   (C++ `Pcp_RescanForSpecs`) refreshes the affected nodes' `has_specs`
//!   flag in place instead of rebuilding, dropping the local index only when
//!   it holds no node at the site (a brand-new spec needs a fresh build).
//!
//! Edit-type → tier, the audit behind the classifier:
//!
//! - `references`, `payload`, `inheritPaths`, `specializes`, `variantSetNames`,
//!   `variantSelection`, `instanceable`, `permission` → significant: each is a
//!   composition-arc, instancing, or permission opinion that can add or drop a
//!   subtree (C++ `Pcp_EntryRequiresPrimIndexChange`). `specifier`, `active`,
//!   `apiSchemas`, and `relocates` are significant here too, slightly broader
//!   than C++ (which routes `active` / `specifier` through separate mechanisms
//!   and does not yet compose `apiSchemas` from a schema registry).
//! - an inert `over` add or remove carrying no significant field → spec tier.
//! - `subLayers`, `subLayerOffsets`, `layerRelocates`, `timeCodesPerSecond` /
//!   `framesPerSecond`, `expressionVariables` on the root → layer-stack tier;
//!   `defaultPrim` on the root → significant at the root.
//! - `clips` / `clipSets`, and non-composition metadata (`kind`,
//!   `colorConfiguration`, `customData`, …) → no index drop. Clips resolve
//!   live through the cached index's spec sites, and every value view rebuilds
//!   against the composition-revision bump [`apply`](Changes::apply) always
//!   makes, so the new opinion is visible without invalidating the graph.
