//! Lazily-built cache of per-prim composition indices.
//!
//! The [`IndexCache`] is the primary interface between [`Stage`](crate::usd::Stage)
//! and the composition engine. It caches one [`PrimEntry`] per composed prim —
//! the [`PrimIndex`] plus the [`CompositionContext`] its children inherit — so
//! ancestor composition is never recomputed.
//!
//! Relocates (`layerRelocates`) are composed by the indexer as `ArcType::Relocate`
//! nodes; the cache applies each node's layer-stack relocates while folding the
//! child-name list (`compute_prim_child_names`), renaming or hiding relocated
//! sources and exposing targets in place.
