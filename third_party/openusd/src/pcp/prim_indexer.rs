//! Task-queue prim indexer (C++ `Pcp_PrimIndexer` port).
//!
//! [`Indexer`] grows a [`PrimIndexGraph`] node-by-node by draining a
//! priority-ordered task queue, mirroring C++ `Pcp_BuildPrimIndex`. The queue
//! follows each composition arc structurally, so reference/payload diamonds — a
//! shared target reached by two arc paths — contribute a node on each path.
//!
//! Ancestral opinions enter through the graph-clone seed (C++
//! `_BuildInitialPrimIndexFromAncestor`): the parent prim's composed graph is
//! cloned and every site path deepened by the child name
//! ([`PrimIndexGraph::append_child_name_to_all_sites`]), so the references and
//! payloads an ancestor introduced are re-evaluated at the deepened path by the
//! same queue. Each node carries its full site layer stack, so deepening only
//! needs to recompute which layers author a spec (`has_specs`).
//!
//! Inherits compose as class-based arcs (C++ `_EvalNodeInherits` →
//! `_AddClassBasedArc`), and a class brought in through a reference is mirrored
//! into the referencing namespace by implied-class propagation (C++
//! `_EvalImpliedClasses` → `_EvalImpliedClassTree`) driven by the queue: an
//! `EvalImpliedClasses` task carries a node's class-based children one level up,
//! repeating until the class reaches the root namespace.
//!
//! An arc whose target is not a root prim is composed as its own sub-index,
//! including the opinions above the target, then grafted under the arc (C++
//! `_AddArc`'s `includeAncestralOpinions` branch → `InsertChildSubgraph`). A
//! borrowed [`Frame`] chain threads the parent graphs back through the nested
//! builds so duplicate-node skipping (C++ `_AddArc`'s `skipDuplicateNodes`)
//! drops a class reached both directly and through an ancestral reference,
//! keeping it grafted once. Ancestral inherits ride the graph-clone seed
//! alongside references and payloads, so a class an ancestor introduces
//! re-evaluates at the child path.
//!
//! Variant sets resolve through a second band of queue tasks
//! (`EvalNodeVariantSets` → `EvalNodeVariantAuthored` → `EvalNodeVariantFallback`
//! → `EvalNodeVariantNoneFound`), weaker than every arc task so the strongest
//! variant selection is known before a variant grafts (C++ `_EvalNodeVariantSets`
//! and friends). The authored/fallback tasks break ties by live node strength,
//! so [`take_best_task`](Indexer::take_best_task) selects the next task with a
//! graph-aware comparator rather than a fixed `Ord`. Selecting a variant grafts
//! the `{set=sel}` site and re-enqueues its own arc and nested-variant tasks,
//! then retries any pending fallback tasks (C++ `RetryVariantTasks`). A nested
//! sub-build skips variants (C++ `evaluateVariantsAndDynamicPayloads == false`),
//! so when its graph is grafted the top-level build re-evaluates every grafted
//! node's local variant sets and the variant sets authored above it through a
//! parallel ancestral band (`EvalNodeAncestralVariantSets` and friends, C++
//! `_EvalNodeAncestralVariantSets` / `_AddAncestralVariantArc`), stronger than
//! the local variant band but weaker than implied classes. The selection itself
//! is composed by `_ComposeVariantSelection`: the set path is first translated to
//! the strongest node it namespace-maps to, then that node's subtree is searched
//! strong-to-weak, so a stronger frame's selection only wins where the mapping
//! reaches it.
//!
//! Specializes compose as globally-weak class-based arcs (C++
//! `_EvalNodeSpecializes` / `_EvalImpliedSpecializes`). A specializes node is
//! added as an inert placeholder where it is authored and copied under the local
//! root (`_PropagateNodeToRoot`); a specializes authored across a reference is
//! carried to every namespace level by the implied-class mechanism (since
//! specializes are class-based), and each level's placeholder is copied to the
//! root too. The copies are ordered among themselves by the C++
//! `PcpCompareSiblingNodeStrength` comparison, placing the globally-weak band after every
//! other opinion (spec 10.4.1). Propagation is add-if-absent on site, so the
//! first placeholder to reach a root site claims the copy and fixes its origin;
//! the copy carries the strongest origin because the seed scan
//! ([`scan_and_enqueue`](Indexer::scan_and_enqueue)) enqueues only expressed-arc
//! tasks for the cloned ancestor graph (C++ `AddTasksForRootNode`), so the
//! seed's propagated specializes are inherited from the clone rather than
//! re-implied in a different order.
//!
//! Implied-class tasks drain descendant-before-ancestor and otherwise
//! strongest-first (C++ `Task::PriorityOrder`'s `EvalImpliedClasses` case), so
//! the strongest implied arc reaches a shared site first.
//!
//! The indexer is the sole composition path ([`Indexer::build`] returns `None`
//! only for a genuine cycle or an unestablished seed, which compose to an empty
//! prim index). It composes the root local site; reference, payload, and inherit
//! arcs to either a root-level or a sub-root target (with the ancestral sub-index
//! and duplicate-node skipping); internal references and `defaultPrim` targets;
//! ancestral reference/payload/inherit propagation through the graph-clone seed;
//! implied classes; local and ancestral variant sets (authored and fallback
//! selections, nested variants, a variant set on a sub-root arc target, and the
//! cross-frame selection composition); specializes (direct, local, and implied
//! across a reference chain — including nested specializes chains and a referenced
//! target with local overrides — copied to the root, plus ancestral specializes a
//! child inherits through the seed-deepened parent graph, whose propagated copies
//! re-evaluate their arcs at the deepened path); and relocates (`eval_node_relocations`
//! composes a relocation source as a sub-index and grafts it, with the
//! prohibited-prim elision for salted earth, and `eval_implied_relocations`
//! grafts the implied relocate up to the grandparent). Known gaps with their
//! reasons are tracked inline and in the [`pcp` module docs](super):
//! specializes/inherit authored inside a selected variant, and
//! relationship/connection target remapping through relocates.
