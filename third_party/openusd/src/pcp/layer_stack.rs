//! Composed layer-stack identity and storage, the composed-view half of
//! composition's layer model.
//!
//! A [`LayerId`] names a physical loaded layer (owned by
//! [`layer_graph`](super::layer_graph)); a [`LayerStackId`] names a composed view
//! of layers — the stage root stack, or a reference/payload target's sublayer
//! stack under a particular inherited expression-variable context. Every composed
//! stack, root included, is a [`LayerStackInstance`] in the [`LayerStackRegistry`]
//! addressed by an opaque [`LayerStackId`]; composition (`Node`, duplicate
//! detection, edit-target info, invalidation, relocate queries) never branches on
//! what kind of stack a handle names — the registry owns the kind, root, seed, and
//! members.
//!
//! This module is identity and storage only. Composing an instance's members
//! needs the layers, which `layer_graph` owns, so it builds them and hands them
//! here (see `LayerGraph::build_stack_members`).
