//! Scene-graph instancing: shared prototypes for `instanceable` prims (spec
//! 11.3.3).
//!
//! Instances with the same [`InstanceKey`] — the arc-introduced opinions that
//! define their subtree, independent of stage path — share one composed
//! prototype. [`PrototypeRegistry`] owns that mapping (an [`IndexCache`] holds
//! one as a field); the composition-coupled glue stays on `IndexCache` because
//! it needs the composed indices. The prototype *namespace* is the single
//! composition of a set of identical instances and composes in place: the root
//! from its materialized `/__Prototype_N` index, a descendant by deepening that
//! graph. Every descendant-serving query enters through
//! [`IndexCache::effective_path`], which redirects an instance proxy `/A/tail`
//! onto `/__Prototype_N/tail` so identical instances are composed only once,
//! while an instance root composes in place (it may override property values).
//! Materializing the root independently keeps its shared content addressable
//! without the seeding instance's root-level overrides leaking in.
