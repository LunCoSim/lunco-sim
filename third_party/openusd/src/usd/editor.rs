//! Stage-level namespace editing, the Rust port of C++ `UsdNamespaceEditor`
//! (`pxr/usd/usd/namespaceEditor.h`).
//!
//! [`NamespaceEditor`] renames, reparents, and deletes prims and properties on
//! a composed [`Stage`], fixing up everything that points at the moved or
//! deleted objects — relationship targets, attribute connections, and internal
//! references / inherits / specializes — and authoring relocates when an
//! object's opinions arrive across a reference or payload arc.
//!
//! Unlike C++, which applies one edit at a time, edits batch: each staging call
//! appends to an ordered queue and [`apply`](NamespaceEditor::apply) commits the
//! whole batch. The batch is sequential — a later edit sees the result of the
//! earlier ones, so `move /A → /B` then `delete /B/Child` resolves naturally.
//! This falls out of the atomic copy-on-write staging: structural ops stage in
//! each layer's overlay, whose reads already reflect the prior edits, and all
//! layers commit together once the batch authors cleanly.
//!
//! The current edit target selects one of two authoring shapes. An identity
//! target on the local root layer stack authors across the whole stack, as C++
//! does: it moves local specs directly and synthesizes `layerRelocates` for
//! content that arrives across a reference or payload arc. A variant or
//! cross-arc edit target authors into the layer stack it writes to — the
//! referenced asset's stack for an arc target, the root stack for a variant —
//! in that target's namespace, with each edit path mapped through the target: a
//! variant move lands at the `{set=sel}` paths, a cross-arc move edits the
//! shared source layer.
//!
//! A mapped target edits whatever its own layer stack can reach. Content with a
//! spec in that stack moves or deletes directly across the stack's layers;
//! content arriving across an arc nested below the target has no spec to move,
//! so the editor synthesizes a `layerRelocates` pair into the target's stack (in
//! the target's namespace) — the only stack where, per spec §10.3.2.6, that
//! relocate takes effect. A source that also composes from a layer stack the
//! target does not own — a stronger override above a reference target, or a
//! sibling arc — cannot be expressed through the target's stack and is rejected
//! ([`RequiresRelocate`](NamespaceEditError::RequiresRelocate)). A move onto a
//! destination already occupied on the composed stage collides
//! ([`DestinationExists`](NamespaceEditError::DestinationExists)) rather than
//! silently merging.
//!
//! In both shapes the structural move is [`copy_spec_within`](crate::sdf::copy_spec_within)
//! plus [`Layer::remove_spec`](crate::sdf::Layer::remove_spec), and the fixup
//! remaps embedded paths in place through
//! [`Value::filter_map_paths`](crate::sdf::Value::filter_map_paths), preserving
//! list-op structure rather than flattening opinions. The local-stack fixup
//! remaps in stage namespace; the mapped fixup lifts each path to stage
//! namespace, follows the batch's moves, then maps it back into the target
//! layer's namespace.
