//! Stage-tier change sinks: observers of a [`Stage`]'s composed-scene changes.
//!
//! A [`StageSink`] is the high tier of the two-level change pipeline. The low
//! tier is [`sdf::LayerSink`], fired at each layer's commit seam; the stage
//! installs an aggregating layer sink on every layer it owns, which records the
//! committed edit so the stage can recompose and, once composition is
//! invalidated, deliver a composed [`CommittedChange`] to every `StageSink`.
//! Higher-level features (change notification, undo/redo, replay, validation)
//! are built as sinks; `Stage` installs none by default, so the no-sink path
//! costs nothing extra.
//!
//! Install with [`Stage::add_sink`](super::Stage::add_sink), which returns a
//! [`StageSinkId`] to later [`Stage::remove_sink`](super::Stage::remove_sink). A
//! plain `Fn(&Stage, &CommittedChange)` closure is itself a `StageSink`, so
//! `add_sink` takes either a full sink type or a quick closure observer.
