//! Promote parameter-variable algebraics to derived parameters.
//!
//! An algebraic whose explicit defining equation has at most *parameter*
//! variability — every reference resolves (transitively) to a parameter,
//! constant, structural loop index, or another parameter-variable algebraic, and
//! never to a state, input, output, or discrete variable — is **constant for the
//! entire simulation**. When a state derivative depends on that algebraic, keeping
//! it in the solver partition forces the derivative to inline or repeatedly solve
//! the constant definition. Promotion is therefore restricted to algebraics on a
//! derivative dependency path, plus structured families whose interiors were
//! deliberately cheapened and must be reconstructed for correctness.
//!
//! Promoting it to a derived parameter — moving the variable into the parameter
//! partition with its defining equation(s) reconstructed into a `Variable.start`
//! binding, and dropping the now-redundant continuous equations — makes it a value
//! evaluated once at parameter-set time. Restricting the transformation to those
//! consumers preserves the declared DAE algebraic structure for unrelated static
//! equations.
//!
//! The DAE may store array equations either as whole-array assignments or scalarized
//! into [`dae::StructuredEquationFamily`] blocks. Promotion therefore: (1) promotes
//! ordinary scalar and standalone whole-array assignments directly, and only
//! promotes structured variables whose entire family is promotable (never
//! splitting a family); (2)
//! reconstructs each promoted array variable's per-element bindings, in equation
//! order, into a flat array `start` expression; and (3) drops the emptied families
//! and shifts the surviving families' `first_equation_index` to match the compacted
//! equation vector.
